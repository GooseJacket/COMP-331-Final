SQ50 - OPENING FANTASY
OPEN ON -- A FAMILY PHOTOGRAPH OF THE TEMPLETONS
TIM V.O.
Time is a funny thing. When I was a
kid, the days lasted forever...
YOUNG TIM
(in the background)
One, two, three...
Land on SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TIM counting against a tree as his
parents and BOSS BABY hide in a bush.
TIM’S MOM
Hide, hide, hide!
TIM’S DAD
Quick! Over here!
YOUNG TIM
Four, five, six...
TIM V.O. (CONT'D)
But the years, well they went by so
fast.
TIM’S MOM
Tim, no peeking!
TIM’S DAD
Yeah, no peeking!
The camera slowly circles the tree.
On the other side of the tree-- TIM IS NOW ALL GROWN-UP.
TIM
Seven, eight, nine... nine and a
half... ten!
TIM V.O
Before you know it, you’re all
grown up. It even happened to me.
TIM
Ready or not, here I come!
FREEZE-- on the goofy face Tim makes as he bursts out to give
chase.
2.
TIM V.O.
My name’s Tim, and this-- well,
this is the rest of my story.
Tabitha pulls Tim’s new baby, TINA, along as they run from
Tim and Tim’s wife Carol LAUGHING--
CAROL
Run for your life!
TABITHA
No fair dad, you peeked!
The scene transitions as the Templetons walk to their car.
TIM V.O.
They call me a stay-at-home dad,
which means I hardly get to stay at
home.
TABITHA
Let’s go!
TIM IS IN A RACE CAR WITH HIS FAMILY
Racing around a track.
TIM
Buckle up Templetons! Ready?
TABITHA
Set!
CAROL
Go!
TIM V.O.
Now, some might say I still have an
overactive imagination, but being a
dad is the coolest job in the
world! A bunch of cool jobs,
really.
Their car rockets ahead across the finish line.
TIM V.O. (CONT'D)
Sometimes, I’m a race car driver.
They pull ahead and cross the finish line... at the grocery
store.
CAROL
Woo! Daddio Andretti!

TABITHA
Yay Templetons!
IN THE KITCHEN--
Tim dressed as an OLD WESTERN CARD SHARK, dealing cards to
Tabitha and Tina.
TIM V.O.
(Western voice)
Well, and then sometimes I’m the
best darn cook in the county, and I
deal out every meal.
-- which transforms into Tim cooking multiple grilled cheese
sandwiches...
TABITHA
Come on pa, hit me!
Tina BURPS.
TABITHA (CONT'D)
Tina!
TIM
Woo doggy! And the house wins
again!
MONSTER VERSIONS OF THE TEMPLETONS gather around Tim as he
operates on a covered figure.
TIM V.O.
(Monster voice)
Or a surgeon, if need be.
TIM
Spork.
CAROL
Spork!
TIM
Spatula.
TABITHA
Spatula!
TIM
Give my creature life!
The Templetons watch as a GIANT LAMB-LAMB rises from the
operating table.

TIM’S DAD
You want some of grandpa?
OUTSIDE
Tabitha and Tina ambush Tim and Ted--
TABITHA
Everyone, get Tag-Along-Teddy!
TIM
Gotcha!
TED
Not in the face!
TIM
Ok, you got me, you got me!
It’s a perfect Christmas scene as the family plays together
in front of the house. We begin to pull up, seeing Wizzie
taking a selfie with Skeletor in the attic, rising above the
neighborhood and into the clouds.
TIM V.O.
It’s true, you can’t stop time. But
every once in a while, you get a
second chance. So even though
you’re only a kid once... Well,
unless, you get to be a kid twice,
which is really weird, to be
honest. But the point is, you have
to grow up sometime. And you should
always be nice to your brother.
BABY TINA V.O.
Aw, that was really sweet daddy.
That’ll be great for my report!
TIM V.O.
Ok, so... So that’s it then!
BABY TINA V.O.
Well, actually, there’s one more
little thing.
The clouds part on--
A SNOWY STREET
Armstrong, without his grown-up suit, approaches the one
house with lights still on.
170.
171.
He knocks.
Two people, ARMSTRONG’S PARENTS, open the door.
DR. ARMSTRONG
Mama? Papa?
Emotional, they scoop him up and hug him tight. Armstrong
allows himself to enjoy this simple comfort.
ARMSTRONG’S DAD
Oh, my son!
ARMSTRONG’S MOM
You came home!
The now complete Armstrong family re-enter the house to start
making up for lost time.
TIM V.O.
Oh yeah, right.
BABY TINA V.O.
Ok pops, now.
TIM V.O.
The end.
FADE TO BLACK
