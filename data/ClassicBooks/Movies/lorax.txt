INT: THEATER - DAY
The Lorax steps onto the stage in front of a large curtain
and addresses the camera.
LORAX
Hello, everybody. Thanks for
coming.
The Lorax CLEARS his throat and reads from a card he holds.
LORAX (CONT’D)
I am the Lorax. I speak for the
trees.
And I’d like to say a few words, if
you please,
Regarding the story that you’re
‘bout to see--
It actually happened--just take it
from me.
But there’s more to this story than
what’s on the page,
So please pay attention while I set
the stage.
The Lorax tosses the card at the audience and walks off as
the curtain opens, revealing Thneedville.
EXT. THNEEDVILLE - DAY
TWO MAINTENANCE WORKERS work on a large “Welcome to
Thneedville” sign. The slogan below it reads, “Fantastic!
Made of plastic! 100% Inorganic.” The camera pushes past
them and flies through the town, down to a suburban street.
LORAX (V.O.)
We open in Thneedville, a city,
they say,
That was plastic and fake, and they
liked it that way.
A Town Without Nature. Not one
living tree.
So what happened to them?
Cue the music!
Let’s see...
EXT. THNEEDVILLE - PRESENT - MORNING
SONG: “THNEEDVILLE”
The MUSIC starts up on a LONG SHOT down the street of
Thneedville suburbs.
All of the houses look basically the same. Electric trees
line the streets instead of street lamps.
An O’Hare Air delivery truck drives down the street.
FLOOSH! An INFLATABLE PLASTIC BUSH inflates. FLOOSH!
Another. FLOOSH! Another. Then--
POP! a bed of PLASTIC FLOWERS pops up in time with the music
complete with PLASTIC BUZZING BEES attached to wires.
PLASTIC BEES
(mechanical voice)
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
The DELIVERY MAN gets out of the truck and grabs an air
bottle from it. He replaces an empty, used air bottle with a
new one like a milkman.

EXT: TED’S HOUSE - PRESENT - SAME
Nearby, TED, an 11-year-old boy and our hero, hops out of his
second floor bedroom window, down a series of stairs, and
flips over the railing into the air and lands on his SCOOTER.
He snaps on his goggles, revs his engine, and takes off down
the street. PULL BACK TO A WIDE SHOT of the entire
neighborhood.
All of the front doors of the houses open simultaneously and
the PEOPLE OF THNEEDVILLE exit their houses singing happily.
EVERYONE
In Thneedville it’s a brand new
dawn!
PEOPLE drive by in their personalized vanity cars, including
a BUSINESSMAN in his large STEAMROLLER SUV.
EVERYONE (CONT’D)
With brand new cars
And houses
And lawns!
We pull back to see the rest of the neighborhood joining the
traffic. Ted follows behind them on his scooter.
EVERYONE (CONT’D)
Here in got-all-that-we-need-ville!

INT: LERKIM - PRESENT - SAME
It’s hard to make out anything in the dark and shadowy room.
Then the Once-ler’s gloved hands appear, grabbing the handle
of a RUSTY OLD AXE next to the Great-Great-Great Grandfather
snail on his desk. We can barely make out the silhouette of
the Once-ler raising the axe over his head, then...
TOWNSPEOPLE (O.S.)
It’s time to banish all your greed
WHACK! He chops away at the boards covering his window.
WHACK! CRACK! The axe breaks through the boards and
sunlight shines into the room for the first time in years.
TOWNSPEOPLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Imagine Thneedville flowered and
treed!
Then, the Once-ler steps into the light and moves toward the
window. We see his face for the first time. Old and
wrinkled, with an enormous, Lorax-like moustache. The Old
Once-ler leans out of the window and listens. Far off in the
distance, he hears voices singing.
TOWNSPEOPLE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Let this be our solemn creed!
The Once-ler’s sad old eyes slowly widen as he realizes what
he’s hearing. Tears begin to well up as he looks down at the
“Unless” stones below him, then back toward Thneedville. A
proud smile creeps across his face.
ONCE-LER
Thank you, Ted.
EXT: TOWN SQUARE - PRESENT - SAME
The crowd of people watch as Ted and Audrey prepare to plant
the little seed into the ground. Rocks surround the hole in
a protective circle (an echo of what the Lorax and animals
did earlier).
EVERYONE
We say let it grow
(in Thneedville)
Audrey leans in and surprises Ted with a kiss on the cheek.
His eyes go wide.
EVERYONE (CONT’D)

It’s a brand new dawn...
Grammy Norma walks over with a watering can as Ted plants the
seed. She waters it and the tree begins to grow towards
camera in time-lapse.
EXT: LERKIM - PRESENT - DAY
Cross dissolve from the sapling in Town Square to one growing
in the desolate wasteland outside of the Lerkim.
The Old Once-ler steps outside with a watering can in hand.
He makes his way over to the UNLESS stones where some small
patches of grass are beginning to grow around the tiny
Truffula tree.
The Once-ler carefully sprinkles water on a few saplings and
smiles. Then, he hears a faint sound off in the distance.
The same sound he heard when the Lorax disappeared into the
sky years ago.
He looks up and sees the smoggy clouds beginning to part. A
ray of sunshine falls upon him and a SWOMEE-SWAN swoops down
from above. The amazed Once-ler watches the bird fly by then
turns to the UNLESS stones where he sees--
The Lorax. Floating back down to the stones. Smiling. The
Once-ler can’t contain himself and LAUGHS IN JOY.
LORAX
You done good, beanpole. You done
good.
The Old Once-ler kneels down and gives him a hug.
LORAX (CONT’D)
By the way, nice mustache.
