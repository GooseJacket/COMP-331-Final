INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES THEATER - NIGHT
A familiar beam of light shines down. The beam of light
descends onto a stage. Lightning flashes to reveal Prince
Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open
plains. The wind blows back his golden mane.
PRINCE CHARMING
Onward Chauncey, to the highest
room of the tallest tower! Where
my princess awaits rescue from her
handsome Prince Charming.
Lightning cracks. Thunder booms. Charming straddles a
wooden hobby horse and gallops in place. A stage hand uses a
bellow to blow air into Prince Charming’s face. Another
stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background.
In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound
effects of a galloping horse. Two more stage hands back
stage create the cheap sound effects of thunder and
lightning. A crudely constructed castle tower sits in front
of a cheaply painted backdrop.
The Fairytale Creatures are sitting at a table in the
audience.
GINGERBREAD MAN
This is worse than Love Letters! I
hate dinner theatre.
PINOCCHIO
Me too.
Pinocchio’s nose grows as he is caught in the lie.
Prince Charming rides to the base of the tower.
PRINCE CHARMING
Whoa there, Chauncey!
He dismounts and sets his hobby horse on the ground. He
strikes a dramatic pose.
A Princess leans from a tower window.
ACTRESS
Hark! The brave Prince Charming
approach-ith.
Prince Charming puffs his chest out.
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 1.
PRINCE CHARMING
Fear not fair maiden! I shall slay
the monster that guards you and
take my place as rightful King.
An old couple at a table look confused.
OLD LADY
(to old man)
What did she say?
Prince Charming glares as the bored audience largely ignores
him.
A man in a bad ogre costume comes onto the stage.
OGRE
Grrrrrrr!
The crowd erupts into applause. The Fairytale Creatures
cheer.
FAIRYTALE CREATURES
(cheering)
Woooo hoooo!!!
GINGERBREAD MAN
Yea! Shrek!
At first, Prince Charming is put off by the cheers for the
Shrek-like beast. He pulls his sword and confronts the
monster.
PRINCE CHARMING
Prepare foul beast to enter into a
world of pain with which you are
not familiar!
He is cut off as a waiter enters with a birthday cake.
WAITER
(singing)
Happy Birthday to thee.
PRINCE CHARMING
Do you mind?
Prince Charming hops out of the way when a chair lands on
stage. It slides past him and bumps into the tower facade.
GINGERBREAD MAN
Do you mind? Bo-ring!
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 2.
DONKEY
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.
A baby ogre pulls ear wax from Shrek’s ear. The baby uses
the wax to draw squiggly lines on a piece of paper.
QUEEN
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy boy.
The Queen is bouncing a baby ogre on her lap. The baby pukes
and the Queen smiles.
There is a knock at the door. Donkey is laying on the floor
holding a bottle with all four hooves, drinking the milk.
Shrek grabs the bottle out of Donkey’s mouth.
DONKEY
Hey.
Shrek opens the front door to reveal the Dwarf.
NANNY DWARF
Where’s the baby?
Shrek puts a bottle into the Dwarf’s mouth and slams the
door.
CUT TO:
EXT. SWAMP HOUSE - DAY
Fiona slides one of the babies down a “slip ‘n slide” made
out of mud shot from geysers. Shrek slides down himself.
The babies scramble out of the way as Shrek slides by,
spraying mud everywhere.
CUT TO:
INT. SWAMP HOUSE - EVENING
Shrek and Fiona are diapering two of the babies in perfect
unison. They continue diapering, Fiona holds up the third
baby and Shrek holds up an unhappy, diapered Puss.
Shrek grabs a gourd bottle off of a shelf. He tosses it to
Fiona.
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 117.
Fiona stands holding one baby over her shoulder. She catches
the gourd thrown to her, twirls it around (a la Tom Cruise in
Cocktail), lifts up her leg where another baby is perched on
her foot and puts the gourd in the baby’s mouth.
Shrek is burping a baby over his shoulder. The baby burps.
Fiona has a baby over her shoulder and the baby burps. A
Dronkey sitting on a chair does a flame-belch and an ogre
baby crawling by farts which causes a flame thrower effect
into the fireplace.
Shrek and Fiona tuck all the babies into bed.
SHREK
Well, what shall we do now?
CUT TO:
INT. SHREK AND FIONA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Shrek and Fiona are sound asleep, snoring.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SWAMP HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
A baby starts to cry.
SHREK
(sighs)
I got it.
The camera trucks out.
