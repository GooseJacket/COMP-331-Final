EXT. NORTH SEA/VILLAGE - NIGHT
We skim above a dark, wild ocean. The camera turns toward a
lone island, Berk. It is a gigantic shard of rock jutting
straight out of the water.
HICCUP (V.O.)
This, is Berk. It’s twelve days
North of hopeless, and a few
degrees South of freezing to death.
It’s located solidly on the
meridian of misery.
The camera drifts over rolling hills to reveal a small
village nestled on an outcropping of sea mounts.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
My village. In a word, sturdy.
And it’s been here for seven
generations, but every single
building is new.
The camera drifts closer, circling.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
We have fishing, hunting, and a
charming view of the sunsets. The
only problems are the pests. You
see, most places have mice or
mosquitos. We have...
Sheep graze peacefully on a hillside. Suddenly one is
snatched.
CUT TO:
INT. STOICK’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
A door is pulled open... as a DRAGON swoops directly toward
it, BLASTING FIRE. The door is SLAMMED. The fire shoots
through the slats of wood, illuminating HICCUP, a gangly
teenage Viking.
HICCUP
...dragons.
EXT. STOICK’S HOUSE
He reopens the sizzling door, as leaps off of the front
porch. He weaves through the erupting mayhem as Vikings pour
out of the buildings, ready for a fight.
More dragons swarm in, setting rooftops alight and hauling
off sheep.
HICCUP (V.O.)
Most people would leave. Not us.
We’re Vikings. We have stubbornness
issues.
Vikings sound the alarm. Viking men and women pour out into
the streets, axes in hand.
ON HICCUP darting through alleys, staying under eaves, making
his way through the battle.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
My name’s Hiccup. Great name, I
know. But it’s not the worst.
Parents believe a hideous name will
frighten off gnomes and trolls.
Like our charming Viking demeanor
wouldn’t do that.
Dragons sweep back and forth, dodging axes and blasting the
Vikings who throw them. A burly warrior gets tossed in an
explosion, knocking Hiccup to the ground.
VIKING
(fierce)
Arggghhhhh!
(cheery, insane)
Mornin'!
Hiccup gets to his feet and continues to rush past gigantic
men and women.
HICCUP (V.O.)
Meet the neighbors. Hoark the
Haggard...
HOARK
What are you doing out!?
HICCUP
... Burnthair the Broad...
BURNTHAIR
Get inside!
HICCUP
... Phlegma the Fierce...
PHLEGMA THE FIERCE
Get back inside!

GOBBER (O.S.)
Well. Most of you.
Gobber pushes through the crowd, beaming proudly.
GOBBER (CONT’D)
(re: the prosthetic leg)
That bit’s my handiwork. With a
little Hiccup flare thrown in.
Think it'll do?
HICCUP
(bittersweet, coming to
terms)
I might make a few tweaks.
Astrid appears and jabs Hiccup in the arm. Hiccup recoils
with a grumble.
ASTRID
That’s for scaring me.
HICCUP
(protesting)
What, is it always going to be this
way? ‘Cause I...
She grabs him aggressively... then kisses him. Hoots and
hollers follow.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
... could get used to it.
Gobber presents Hiccup with a rebuilt saddle, rigging, and
tail.
GOBBER
Welcome home.
Suddenly, Toothless pounces on the crowd, crushing several
unsuspecting Vikings under his weight.
VIKING
Night Fury, get down!
Toothless eyes the new tail excitedly, tongue wagging. Amidst
the groans and grumbles, Hiccup and Astrid exchange a
sheepish grin.
CLOSE ON
CLOSE ON
Hiccup's prosthetic foot, snapping into the modified stirrup.
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 104.
The two pieces click together, forming a single shape.
Astride Toothless, he's whole again. He rotates the pedal.
The new tail opens. Bright red with a skull and Viking horns
emblazoned on it. Hiccup approves.
CUT BACK TO REVEAL...
Hiccup and Toothless, saddled up and ready to fly. Astrid
backs her Nadder into position.
HICCUP
(to Toothless)
You ready?
Toothless SNORTS an excited 'yes!'
From his mount, Hiccup looks out over the changed world.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
This... is Berk.
(beat)
It snows nine months of the year...
and hails the other three.
They LEAP into the bright blue sky, together as one. Astrid
follows, giving chase.
HICCUP (CONT’D)
Any food that grows here is tough
and tasteless. The people that grow
here are even more so.
Hiccup and Astrid race their dragons through the village --
under eaves, over rooftops, down cliff-sides, and between
ship masts. It's a high energy, romantic dance of sorts.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
The only upsides are the pets.
While other places have...ponies or
parrots, we have...
Their fellow recruits join them as they take to the open sky,
rocketing far above the village. The Northern sky swirls with
blazing, multicolored dragons.
Hiccup and Toothless break from the pack, spinning into the
blinding sun.
HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT’D)
(proudly)
... dragons.
