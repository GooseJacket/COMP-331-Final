MOTHER(0 . S . )
Good night, Sweetheart.
LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
G'night, Mom.
FATHER (O.S.)
Sleep tight, Kiddo!
1.
The bedroom light CLICKS off. Soft moonlight illuminates the
room. A little boy snuggles into bed as his parents'
footsteps fade away down the hall. All is quiet.
The closet door CREAKSopen. The boy looks arour!d the room
nervously, eyes growing wide. Suddenly, he spies a TENTACLE,
emerging from the closet. The boy turns away in fear, but a
second look reveals it to be just a SHIRT SLEEVE. He relaxes
back into bed.
A DARK SHADOWcuts across the bedspread. From under the bed,
a pair of EVIL RED EYES peer out.
Rising up behind the boy, preparing to scare his young
victim, towers a FEARSOMEMONSTER.
The .boy sees the monster and SCREAMS.
The monster, horrified by the child, lets out an even more
blood curdling SCREAMof his own.
He backs away and slips on a soccer ball, which ricochets off
the wall and beans him squarely on the face. He stumbles
back onto a skateboard, slips, and lands on a pile of JACKS.
.Crazed with pain, the monster runs around the room, SQUEALING
and holding his backside.
COMPUTERIZEDVOICE (O.S.)
Simulation terminated. Simulation
terminated.
Worklights flash on, flooding the room with light. The boy,
now revealed to be an ANIMATRONTIC,winds down and ·resets.
One wall of the bedroom starts to rise, revealing ...
INT. SIMULATOR/TRYOUTROOM, DAY
~- The bedroom is a set, a simulator where monsters practice
their scare tactics.
Behind a control console sits an evaluator, the dragon-like
MS. FLINT. Judging by her tone, she's been through this
before.
FLINT
(to our monster}
Alright, Mr ... Bile, is it?
BILE
Uh, my friends call
FLINT
Uh huh. Mr. Bile,

BILE

FLINT
me Phlegm.

No, no, before that! Can anyone tel1 me
Mr. Bile's big mistake? Anyone?
Flint addresses a panel of pathetic looking RECRUITS, seated
behind her. They stare back at her blankly.
FLINT (CONT'D)
(frustrated)
Let's take a look at the tape. Here we
go.
Flint rewinds the tape, then plays it.
ON THE MONITOR: Bile sneaks into the bedroom, leaving the
door open. The image freezes.
FLINT (cont'd)
Right ... there! See? The door. You
left it wide open.
RECRUITS/BILE
Oooh.
FLINT
And leaving a door open is the worst
mistake any employee can make because ... ?
BILE
Um... it could ... let in a draft?
VOICE ( 0 . S. )

Sullivan follows Mike with a SIGH.

SULLIVAN

MIKE
(chiding)

my voice. Okay ... stop! Open 'em.
121.
Sulley opens his eyes. Before him sits BOO'S RECONSTRUCTED
DOOR, meticulously glued back together.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Tada!
Sullivan stops, _scarcely able to believe what he's seeing.
S'QLLIVAN
Mike? Is that . .. ?
MIKE
Sorry it took so long pal. There was a
lot of wood to go through.
Mike's hands are covered with SPLINTERS and BAND-AIDS.
MIKE (CONT'D)
You know, it only works if you have every
piece.
The door is clearly missing a piece. Sullivan looks down to
his clip board where the sliver of Boa's door is taped.
Sullivan fits the piece into the door. It fits perfectly.
The red light above the door glows.
Mike smiles and steps aside.
",r-- Sullivan reaches for the door-knob.
122.
INT. BOO'S ROOM, DAY
The door opens. Sullivan's nervous face is hit with light as
he scans the room.
SULLIVAN

Sullivan smiles.
