Sitting all alone in a boxed room
looking at the walls locking in on me
looking like they are about to fall in and 'BOOM'
wondering what my life is going to be.
thinking to myself should i take that step out of the door
or maybe just sit here and cry for myself
'but what is there to life for' i should just lay here on this cold floor
i can't even call for help because i am all by myslef.: (

I walked alone
In Ann Arbor last night,
But you were
With me again on South Main
Among the college kids,
The restaurants and book stores,
Everyone moving around,
The folk music
Coming from the Ark;
Sweet Lady, you’ve won my heart,
Even though we continue to linger
So painfully apart.

The sorrow of riverside blossoms inexplicable,
And nowhere to complain -- I've gone half crazy.
I look up our southern neighbor. But my friend in wine
Gone ten days drinking. I find only an empty bed.
A thick frenzy of blossoms shrouding the riverside,
I stroll, listing dangerously, in full fear of spring.
Poems, wine -- even this profusely driven, I endure.
Arrangements for this old, white-haired man can wait.
A deep river, two or three houses in bamboo quiet,
And such goings on: red blossoms glaring with white!
Among spring's vociferous glories, I too have my place:
With a lovely wine, bidding life's affairs bon voyage.
Looking east to Shao, its smoke filled with blossoms,
I admire that stately Po-hua wineshop even more.
To empty golden wine cups, calling such beautiful
Dancing girls to embroidered mats -- who could bear it?
East of the river, before Abbot Huang's grave,
Spring is a frail splendor among gentle breezes.
In this crush of peach blossoms opening ownerless,
Shall I treasure light reds, or treasure them dark?
At Madame Huang's house, blossoms fill the paths:
Thousands, tens of thousands haul the branches down.
And butterflies linger playfully -- an unbroken
Dance floating to songs orioles sing at their ease.
I don't so love blossoms I want to die. I'm afraid,
Once they are gone, of old age still more impetuous.
And they scatter gladly, by the branchful. Let's talk
Things over, little buds ---open delicately, sparingly.

The day Caleb died
I was all alone
Lying in a hospital bed
So white and cold
Bleeding
Though I was all alone
The day Caleb died
I was all alone
Praying for someone to come
Watching the door
Hoping and praying
But I was all alone
The day Caleb died
I was all alone
I almost died too
Yet no one was around
And there was no one to hold
For I was all alone
The day Caleb died
I was all alone
I prayed for God to take me, too
But I didn't go
I prayed for someone to hold
But I was all alone

I hang my head in my burning palms,
tears sting against my soul, searching
for the calm. Heartaches like never
before, broken, so lonely and torn.
Never to see the light, no tunnel to
be seen, sitting here alone, within my
silent screams. No hand to reach for, no
one to hold me close, I have never
felt so alone.
No one to pull me to safety, no one to
turn to, just broken hearted, searching
for life anew. No embrace, just tears
that fall down my face.
No guarantees on life or love, nothing
but dark clouds linger above. The world
tightens her grip with every breath I take,
making the next step impossible to take.
Alone in a world, the void is here, taking
over my being, taking my life, but in this
void I lose the strife. Haunting thoughts
consume me, just looking through these
tears, just wanting to be free.

Life is the cage
We are all born into
The zoo
Drives down the long
Snake in the rain,
Everyone sits alone
In the park
In the car
In the theatre
Everyone sits alone
And looks through bars
Of their flesh and bone
No eager hand
can grasp out of this
No willing hand has the
Reach,
We touch our flesh
To the flesh of our cages,
We lay down chained
And little birds sing
Beside others miles away
And barking
We touch steering wheels
As the lights cross our eyes
We learn to believe
The birth of shadows
We drive, a line of slaves,
Down the road
Everyone sits alone.

In the beginning our Father was alone wanting company.
So to Himself said, 'I'll just create friends to suit my fancy.'
They will all be Holy angels having freedom of choice.
These Holy angels will be perfect in beauty having a voice.
All these angelic beings will have wings to fly away.
But I will set boundaries and limits where they are to stay.
They will also have eyes to see where to stop.
With ears to hear praises from the top.
By now the angels were given the sense of touch.
To the hierarchy in Heaven, was loved very much.
This sense of touch could be the feel of a wheel.
Boy what a deal.
And among other things could be pleasure,
With God's measure.
This pleasure with God's measure,
was their treasure.
All these spirits were given a mind.
To especially be kind.
Possessing abilities to voice their choice.
Think at a blink, even wink, not blind.
Hearing with ears even from behind.
The rank of the Cherubim was made of winged little girls and boys.
These Cherubs walked and talked with God who gave them toys.
The boys played with balls.
The girls played with dolls.
These Cherubs were happy, being content with all.
God was pleased with what He saw.
God gave all angels senses of smell and taste.
Instructing them they could lick in haste.
But never to taste paste or waste.
God gave angels given knowledge.
This sixth sense not taught in college.
The wisdom acquired,
Will be required.
If so desired.
So stay chaste.
For the chase.
Being eternally chased.
At this time there was no sin, which is vice.
Everything in Heavens chorus was joyous and nice.
Our Father is Perfect So He didn't have to think twice.
He made no mistakes that could not be corrected.
When creating He got exactly what He expected.
Through His Perfection is why God is always respected.
Every thing God created,
Never became outdated.
He could raise His finger,
To invent some timber.
Or blink an eye,
Creating the sky.
That Perfect magic Man could make something,
Simply out of nothing.
God created no two things exactly the same.
A female angel by nickname,
Was called a dame.
God could create showers,
For all the flowers.
What was left of the rain,
Ran down the drain.
After these showers.
The man took to the dame.
As a gift, these flowers.
For the main spirit game,
Was to win the dame.
Then your spirit life and her name.
Would never be the same.

*inspired when I was doing slavery in class
-------
These chains that bind my body,
Shall not bind my mind,
The skin taken from my flesh,
Shall not blind my sight,
These tears they shall not spill,
Till wrongs and rights are justed,
The dirt upon the my knees,
Is not my souls one colour,
My body you may own,
My mind is mine alone,
My soul it nests in His hands,
My life is mine alone.

There is no place or grace, for all the human race
The race of will, to race and kill
As anger fills and kills the thrill
That we hold near and dear, we cherished children fear
The wraith of God, the wraith of man
The wraith of future shines the plan
That we can maul it all, from front to back we saw
The answer here, the answer there
And never thought to question where
Did anger’s state of hate, combined collaborate
That one is right, and powering
Then one will fight for might to sing
The battle long of song, dividing right from wrong
The death of you, the death of me
The death of us for all to see
No one can own this bone, together we’re alone

It is raining
Slowly
In Detroit tonight.
It makes you think
God has
No sense of time.
Somewhere in the world
There is a girl
Who should have
Her forehead kissed
Before she falls asleep

She's sweet as a honey on a bacon
fitted like icings on a cake;
So cloudy, bloomy, and easy
in her own world in calvary.
She seems confused of things can be
like a sunbeam hiding underneath a tree;
You would look at her in gloomy feather
never have gotten to fly on free!
She's sweet as a honey on a bacon
fitted like icings on a cake;
So intriguing, lighting, and melting
in her own world of flying.
She seems downed of things will be
like a skyhawk revving up a sea;
You would see her flirting the storm
never have gotten to land on free!
Oh sweet as it may my angel from home
The whole wide world is yours alone!
Have to carry it last deep in your heart
Your moment of happiness never go fast.

I squint through the keyhole,
Push open the door,
Pearly white feathers lie strewn on the floor.
From pigeons these feathers could well have been hacked,
But blood streams in rivers from a dark angel's back.
Who would have committed this hideous crime?
Pulled the wings off an angel and hurled her through time?
The knife in her grasp silently answers for me,
There's a reason she sits there, all naked and gory.
To be human's her wish,
Just one sacrifice.
Will grant her desire,
Her wings will suffice.
Her hair is all matted and her hand shakes with pain,
But her eyes show no loss,
Only sparkle with gain.
She's amazed at the knowledge that she's human at last,
Time to move on and invent a new past.
Her bright smile falters,
Her eyes show new fear.
No longer immortal,
Her blood debt's too dear.
I back through the feathers still scattered on the floor,
Take the key from the keyhole and pull shut the door.

guess what? other boys
ask god for heaven, holiday
and presents but i ask god
for an angel, white angel
with his big feathery wings
like what we see of gabriel
and guess what? yes, god did send
the angel to my dream one night
so huge were his wings
i found myself ruffling the feathers
as he stood tall
without even uttering a word
the strong feathers
which felt so warm
then the sudden fear
that he was coming
to take away mother
angel does this thing
says the bible
how i had cried
screamed that he would not
take mom away
the heaven reverberated
with my plea
i woke up tearsoaked
and glad that it was just a dream
glad that god had let me
see an angel
an angel with his large
feathery wings
that stands so tall

I owe my every effort to
Her love, everlasting and true.
In her silence, I am able to speak
and see all things beautiful.
She never left me.
She isn't gone.
I walk in solitude,
but never alone.
The angel watches me.
And in my dreams
she visits me
with a smile that's comforting
And in the morning, when I wake
I have her song to sing.

I know I haven't really been a good friend,
and I know I could of tried a little harder,
but you see I can't tell you,
how I feel about you,
the world would reject me if I did,
but I'm willing to try,
and go over the edge,
and show you how I Feel about you,
when we meet,
I was in such bad shape,
my life was crumbling all around me,
until I meet you,
my life was engulfed in darkness,
I was engulfed in my own self-pity,
I had an inescapable demon,
living inside of my head,
I had pain inside of heart,
I felting nothing but pain,
for months and months,
I thought it was inedible,
until I meet you that day,
not really suspecting anyone that would,
really care about me,
not suspecting that anyone that would even love me,
love me,
like the way that you do,
My Angel (In The Darkness)
My Angel (In The Darkness)
My Angel (In The Darkness)
I couldn't believe what I was seeing,
nor what I was saying or what I was hearing,
the world had rejected you for what you are,
and what you've done,
but do they have the eyes that I do?
was it insane of me,
to see you as the angel,
that I know you are,
and not the demon that they all make you out to be,
was I insane to see the goodness inside of you,
and was it crazy that you took the darkness outside of me,
My Angel (In The Darkness)
My Angel (In The Darkness)
My Angel (In The Darkness)
We spent each day,
and we spent each know confessing,
our sins to each other,
like it was alright,
and we knew we'd listen to each other,
but I must confess,
that’s not all that I need,
that’s not all that I want,
all that I need,
and all that I want is your love,
and your sweet choice,
the way that you would look at me and smile,
and tell me everything was going to be alright,
and just help me hold on a little bit longer,
hold on a little bit longer,
My Angel (In The Darkness)
My Angel (In The Darkness)
My Angel (In The Darkness)
she told me its okay,
to let your feelings go,
and tell people how you feel,
and if you love them,
but I couldn't really do that,
there was only one person that I've loved,
one person I could only love unconditionally
and love without temptation,
She’s My Angel (In The Darkness) ,
The only Angel I'm going to love,
My Angel (In The Darkness) ,
the only Angel I trust
My Angel (In The Darkness)
as she was there for me,
I'm going to be there for her,
I'm know her Angel In the darkness,
I am know the one that will love her unconditionally
and without temptation,
I just wanted her to know,
how much I love her and cherish her,
I love you,
My Angel (In The Darkness)

You are my angel-
My pretty angel.
Let me hold you tight,
Won't you love me tonight?
My angel,
My dear, sweet angel,
You make me feel so right.
My darling angel,
You are my destiny...
Let me be your fantasy.
Please show your heart to me.
My Angel, you mean so much to me....
I'd follow you across the sea.
Angel, please open your arms to me.
I'm hoping you will see,
Just what your love means to me.
My dearest angel,
Put desire in flight.
We'll soar like a kite,
For love is in sight.
My sweet angel,
Make me your lover.
We'll love each other....
For you are my angel,
And I'll love no other.

The Angel that presided o'er my birth
Said, 'Little creature, form'd of Joy and Mirth,
'Go love without the help of any Thing on Earth.'

The first time we meet
in New York City
it will be snowing.
No one will stop
to take a picture
of us as we stand
inches apart and shake
hands on a busy street
corner.  Taxicabs
will continue to pass,
splattering dirty slush
onto our wool coats.
We will walk
in silence to a cafe
where we'll sit
for hours sipping
espresso, fingering sugar
packets.  The smoke
from your cigarette
will rise and hover
around your head
like mist in a grave-
yard covering
a tombstone at dawn,
the epitaph barely readable.
Just after midnight
you will lean forward,
your face-pale
and thin-emerges
from the haze, eyes
dark as skulls',
and slowly, unnoticed,
we will kiss.

Sometimes we get angry
over the silliest of things,
but it is not anger,
but frustration
over something we cannot do.
If we could have done it,
there would have
been no anger there.
There is no easy solution
to get over it.
It is part of our nature
I am afraid to say.
The sad thing is
it will never go away.
We will always suffer the frustration
and the anger that goes with it.
9 May 2008

Anger lay by me all night long,
His breath was hot upon my brow,
He told me of my burning wrong,
All night he talked and would not go.
He stood by me all through the day,
Struck from my hand the book, the pen;
He said: ‘Hear first what I’ve to say,
And sing, if you’ve the heart to, then.’
And can I cast him from my couch?
And can I lock him from my room?
Ah no, his honest words are such
That he’s my true-lord, and my doom.

Anger, a spark, within all of us.
There, anger is lurking, waiting to
ignite the dynamite, that will
cause an explosion of words,
and actions, that can not be taken back.
Anger, is the roadblock, to anything
and everything, worthwhile in life.
Anger, seemingly an involuntary reaction,
to rejection of thought or action.
Anger, an interpretation, of unacceptable behavior.
Anger, almost always followed by regret.
Anger, an emotion. who's children are,
anxiety, fear, frustration, animosity, passion,
outrage and a thousands of other, emotionally
affecting articulations.
Anger, the replacement of reason.
What is the enemy of anger? The
enemy of anger, is, patience, understanding
and love.
Anger, the emotion, the world would be
far better off, without.

Shut up, go cry
I want you to fucking die
You cheat
You lied
F**k your life
We're through
I no longer give a s**t about you
Your pain
Is my pleasure
Your my worthless treasure
Your fake
You'll break
Now leave me
Never show your face again.

How is anger escaped?
It stays deep within me.
I think about what is lost,
and the anger rises inside of me.
Every where I look,
I see what should be mine.
Envy turns to anger,
I think to myself 'who are these people? ,
they do not deserve such a thing I have lost'
I think about what is lost,
and the anger rises inside of me.
It rises to such a degree,
that anger turns to tears.

Searing reason and rationale,
With the seething rage of rash,
Like the red blaze in wild jungle,
Anger, in its impulsive brash,
Melts all hope’s and dreams to ash;

Be slow to anger
And  much quicker to love.
God didn't make mankind
To hate, hurt and our neighbors begrudge.
He gave each of us the holiest of gifts
Something we all posses.
And in our hearts, is where God’s love does its best.
So when you feel your anger building up inside
Go and give it to God, let in Him there reside.
His love is sufficient for all you see
He lives inside of you and me.
To bring mankind hope, joy and love
He gives it freely, from His Father God above.
It will smoother out any of anger's wrath
He will beat it up with the Holiest of bats!
He will beat it down, deep into the ground
So far, that your anger my friend
Will never again, ever be found.

Incisions marked with skin of silk,
I am vulnerable,
true to flesh and bone,
I am human,
capable of making the light dissapear within my fingertips.
I love and hate,
as such reactions towards the darkness I look on knowing that I
just won't make it...
Cracked up smiles and blurry faces try to escape the side of your,
sweet prescence,
thinking that a girl so ignorant such as she could sustain her
anger much longer.
She must be human for she feels what she's been taught.
Self pity is what she wants,
so her selfishness she will get,
even if her veins burn with envy,
or tower over with regret.
You've tried so hard to stay so strong
but obviously not enough,
You know you can make it through to him
so act like you're tough.
These burned bridges are slowly finishing it's trail,
and silence will be joined at the end,
until then she'll stay a ruined creation of the world,
she'll live or make ammend.

I do not express my anger
I prefer to be at peace
I go away from present danger
and my problems begin to cease
But I grieve, for it cannot last
My anger refuses to be ignored
Painful memories from the past
Have become a ruler and a lord
They rule over my mind with brute force
I cannot help but to cry
Of actions they cause I have much remorse
Because of these crimes, I deserve to die
Anger trapped within
has become my torture, my sorrow, my sin

When one is called simple
that may simply not be so.
A context in rhythm
is an arrogant conception,
a bereavement of solace
and an independent curator of time.
Hell hops the furry forward
and the breath of ones
own mother horn the adjunct.
A brazen blow to a humorous head
A jackal knightly; a usefull dish
among the kindled flame of orange hue.
Anticipate this. A brush with
the word; a coffin to suit the
most pleasurable death.
A just moment and a comprehensible
tip should not a hearty meal choke.
This is the metal, the straight
that bores the iron and shields man.

nice to be an animal
free from worry and care
no possessions
no clothes to wear
no toothbrush or comb
sleep anywhere
no clock to watch nor time to keep
sun and moon with you, awake or asleep
away from it all
enjoying woods and field
no rush hour to negotiate
your animal spirit healed
mate with whomever
no marriage endeavor
'poor' as you both are -
on a wild date - gaze at a falling star
never a need to cook
food from soil, stream or forest nook
eat your meat and veggies raw
no fork or knife - use your beak or paw
wild, surprising adventure
every challenging day
nature intended an interesting life
this natural way

Dragged down to the ground with a shoulder out of place
A man struggles all about, anguish carved into his face
His attacker stands up, but only for a moment
He takes this time out to notice his blood roaming
A second later he feels a sharp pain in his back
His attacker brought his knee down with all the force he had
One, and two, and three times he fell
Screaming each time like the damned souls of hell
The man lay still, mind adrift in the wind
Sees the smiling faces and him amidst his kin
They reach out to him and he reaches in return
Only to return to a fire that’s started to burn
His attacker must’ve tired because it seemed like some time
Since he felt any blows manhandling his spine
He could be paralyzed, in any case
He couldn’t just lie there and die
His attacker stood at his head like one of prominence
Spit on the man and asserted his pure dominance
But suddenly dropped to the floor in agonizing pain
The man had cut a tendon and a very lively vein
Blade in hand and moving as fast as stone
The man crept to his attacker and brought the point home
Over and over as his eyes filled with tears
Collapsed on his attacker and let go of his shears
Barely breathing but alive he can hear the fans cheer

Day in day out i struggle
i have no future
None that i can see
nothing hopeful
nothing that can take from me this pain
nothing but one
death..
My life is one
uncaring
My life is one
ungrateful
my life is one
neglect
my life is one
death
Its difficult
for me to understand
its difficult
for me to
recall
If i had ever found out
why..
my life revolves in a cage
a cage of despair, death and steel
Yet i have it lucky
luckier than most
its painful
to see your own die
they don't care
they don't regret
my life consists
of no more than pain
helpless, hopeless pain
we never wronged them
we never interfered
we never hurt them
then why?
what..what did we do?
nothing...
Its hard to stay positive
its hard to remain hopeful
its hard to keep living
but we still do
and will do
until all hope is gone
Its difficult to live
When your life consists of nothing more than pain most days
Severe pain
It funny to know
the value of your life is nothing
nothing more than a beauty product
and perhaps for the lucky a cigarette.
Its painful to remember
the days strapped to the cold cold rack
while your eyes slowly melted away
wht coul you do but suffer
you could cry out but no one would come
Its tormenting to see
and feel your skin shrivel away
burnt and bloody
as the acid ate in
Its painful to know that you are slowly poisoned
and left to see whether you live of die
all that we could do was whimper
and some not even that
For us there is no hope
For us, no faith
For us, no remorse
only a slow painful death
This is no modern world
This is no intelligent race
This is no kind people
And we know
as we slowly crumble
the best part of it all is death...

'Do vegetarians eat animal crackers? '
Was what I was asked one day.
It was a man on the street,
And that's all he would say.
My reply to him was,
'I do not know.
But I'll find out for you.
So now I will go.'
So I went to a center,
Where some vegee-heads ate.
And I asked them my question,
With no further delay.
Their answer to me,
Made me laugh close to dead.
'Of course we do silly,
We bite off their heads! '

Few things rules the world,
And all are, almost all are very keen to it,
Like removing the clothes; bit by bit,
Kiss- killing is so simple-
It is hiss,
Closed door love if unveiled,
Sex is a sonnet if made it an Ode,
Make a painting with molten wax,
That must symbolize sex,
Running sexual commentary is attention getter,
Let all the secrets must be opened,
Charm of sex will run away,
There will be no rape,
There will be no molestation,
No teasing on sexual basis,
Let us write -
All known secrets—
What harm in it?
Let human be animal-
I know animal instinct is still alive

My dear Monsieur,
Which party,
Do you party with?
I fear it is all
You have done.
Party and rumble.
Your brain has slipped
From your pocket,
And your politics
Are long forgotten,
Sitting in a wine glass.

There is an animal, with ferocious
Eyes, tamed and beautiful;
Sturdy hands filled with strength
The body of a predator skilled
Yet he hides it, a mask,
Covers him and his instinct.
To let him mingle with the rest,
For the others are different than he
The dark animal is none other but me.
The feel to commit what is wrong
Burns with passion inside the brute.
Steal and kill and hurt and fulfill,
The condemned thirst.
The wrong is always right it thinks
What's the harm in wrong doing?
As long as it doesn't kill you
Be the brute, it tells you.
The dark animal is none other but me.
Ah! What lust for blood and bones?
To grind and ravish and consume,
The bones and blood of the one
Who is mine. To conquer and
Dominate and protect
Like an animal but I am a man?
Yet the instinct lives and grows,
To find the one who will be only mine.
The dark animal is none other but me.
I loose myself to the animal at times
And doom embraces me all the while,
Is there no one who can save me?
No, the animal laughs menacingly
I am done with my life
I do not want to live with the wildness inside of me
The gun points towards me
Yet I manage to survive
For I am too scared for my life.
It is precious to the animal
Equally treasured by me.
The dark animal is none other but me.
I try hard to control my beast,
Which craves to hurt and to kill,
The unjust, the cruel and the innocent!
At times for fun, at times to punish.
It bathes in the cries of the tortured,
And smiles when he sees their anguished faces.
It moves my limbs without my control,
And the next second, I'm me staring
At a face unknown, I try hard to win against.
The dark animal is none other but me.
The animal does not diminish
But grows and slowly I am disappearing.
I fight and fight but he is unnaturally strong
I cannot remove it, cannot throw it,
It is a part of me, which is right at times
And wrong too. I make agreements
With this beast to act when I want it to,
The altering animal is none other but me.
I work, I fight, I control, I rule
The animal lives inside me.
I have tamed the animal a little
The lust for blood and bones remain,
The mask hides his true nature,
The urge to kill has lessened,
A sense of morality is infested.
The animal is becoming into me
My part coming back to me.
The restrained animal is none other but me.

Why won't the acclaimedly intelligent beings of the animal world,
Called the humans,
Eventually understand the language of their fellow creatures?
What for example the message of two cute icebears were,
Who, amidst the dreadful melting away,
From underneath their bear feet, of
Their ice-shaped habitat on the Polar Cap,
Experienced already for over two generations,
Took to such great pains as to
Embarking on a hazardous
Kind of last-chance kamikaze trip of
Hundreds of kilometers,
Partially swimming, partially afloat
Atop drifting ice blocks,
All the way from Greenland to Iceland:
'It is you, you presumptive two-legged lords on the planet,
None else but
You,
With these magic mirrors of your killer-blink-eye hanging
Around your proud necks,
Who art guilty of the reckless diminishing of
Our home in the polar ice!
Since you are ultimately bound for extinguishing us altogether:
Shorten this painful life now,
Shoot, if you can, now! '!
People's lives are led in this magic mix of our world,
So you say,
By intuitions from consequences
We choose to involuntarily take part in,
And you say,
For a major part
People's lives are led
By all these fair & unfair provisions of Providence
We inevitably take shares in,
And by intimidations and by acts of aggression for self-maintenance,
So you say, our lives are led, too.
I once asked a modern Socrates about this thing,
One bald-headed bold-hatted clear-minded thinker
With a prickly animal instinct in his head -
One also you might have met already once
In a tiny far away forest ville.
He remarked to my questions:
'But where is the will of the animal in this concept? '
Well, well  well, I said, and am pondering now:
'What makes any whale suffer to go back up the Thames again, after a lapse of 92 turns of the sun? '
I now feel the winds of the will in modern scientific man
When he spreads
'The life of a whale wistfully straying in people's waterways
Must be that of one misled! '
And this is a true story about
A baffling co-operation of
Three wild elephants in a remote
Village in India.
Whatever their reasons for doing that,
This is what they've done:
After nightfall, when all the villagers
Were already in their houses,
The Elephants marched up to the house of the wealthiest
Family of the village,
One of them posting itself at the main door,
The other at the back door,
While their third colleague stomped right
Through the door into the house,
To be then,
To the total bewilderment of the onlooking family members,
Raiding the house's food supply, carrying off
Sacks of rice along with vegetables,
Without but having hurt anyone of the family,
But having made sure
That none of them could have
Fled from that scene of terror,
Most probably an act of vengeance
On part of the animals
For being terrorized by the locals themselves,
Such as by denuding their forests.

As a drenched, drowned bee
Hangs numb and heavy from a bending flower,
So clings to me
My baby, her brown hair brushed with wet tears
And laid against her cheek;
Her soft white legs hanging heavily over my arm
Swinging heavily to my movements as I walk.
My sleeping baby hangs upon my life,
Like a burden she hangs on me.
She has always seemed so light,
But now she is wet with tears and numb with pain
Even her floating hair sinks heavily,
Reaching downwards;
As the wings of a drenched, drowned bee
Are a heaviness, and a weariness.

They are the Baby Boomers
Born to reunited families
Split by the war
A baby boom
Felt around the World
They were to change humanity
1955 started a revolution
Their parent's music was boring
New music was jumping
They turned up the volume
Hips started to gyrate
Rock 'n' Roll was Satan's music
Slick hair swivelling hips
A southern boy from Tennessee
Was every father's nightmare
He was everywhere
Records TV and movies
Elvis Presley was king
Baby boomers and their music
Changed the world forever
Children of the revolution
Starting to ask why
Growing beards and long hair
All roads led to San Francisco
Sex drugs and rock 'n' roll
Boomers were very different
Never to get old
Their parents always looked old
The World changed for them
Catering their every need
Trying not to sound like parents
Boomers invented living together
Kids without weddings
Naming them Sky and Summer
Maturing into jobs
Responsible and hard working
Spoilt their kids with
Stereos TVs and phones
Most forgot the sixties
Short hair suit and tie
Making a corporate fortune
To support the new lifestyle
Don't have to grow old
First generation not to
Women wear girls clothes
Fathers and sons t shirt and jeans
Radio stations play their music
Discos for the over 40's
Sports activities and clothes
Have aged with them
Once sport finished at thirty
Now we have over sixty's sport
Never too old for anything
Boomer will always be young

Baby Love, walk with me
Hold my hand
Set me free
With a single red rose, under a tree
I love your big beautiful blue eyes
And the way you wriggle those thighs
In the middle of the night I endlessly fantasize
Kisses, touches, moans - my dream comprises
Baby Love, walk with me
Please!
Baby Love, talk to me
Please!
Every single elegant day
Your centre stage is on display
In my own loving Romeo play
They say dreams do come true
Will you appear suddenly out of the blue?
I love your long beautiful smile
Long and beautiful as the River Nile
Your mesmerizing face tells many a tale
With successful conquests I wish to hail
When is it time for us to set sail
Baby Love, walk with me
Please!
Rock me gently
Please!
I love your dazzling strong hands
Kisses, laughter, adventures - the whole brand
It is this love of you I softly demand
Your eyes speak, they understand
Walk with me
Please!
Baby Love, walk with me
Kiss my lips
As I close my eyes
Unlock my heart with your key
Set me free
With a single red rose, under a tree

I know a baby, such a baby, -
Round blue eyes and cheeks of pink,
Such an elbow furrowed with dimples,
Such a wrist where creases sink.
‘Cuddle and love me, cuddle and love me,’
Crows the mouth of coral pink:
Oh, the bald head, and, oh, the sweet lips,
And, oh, the sleepy eyes that wink!

By day he was a plumber, a regular one of the boys,
But by night he ran Ladies Parties, selling fantasy sex-toys.
And when a plumbing he did go, the ladies liked his tools for sure
Which explains all his discount rates, when being paid behind the door.
One customer seemed quite nervous, when she got her boiler serviced
Unknown to him, amused herself, with rampant rabbits or anything else!
His bag that day was choc-a-block with wrenches for wenches and sex-party stock.
And as he worked, behind his back, she secretly rummaged in his sack.
His work was interrupted, while adjusting his tape measure,
From the room along the hall he heard her moans and screams of pleasure.
“I love this tartan dildo, and this kinky rubber mask! ”
He said, “I can sell you the mask, my dear. But not my thermos flask! ”

Softly comes the night,
Moon Woman walks the land.
Rest well, my little one,
Member of a proud band.
And in Dream Catcher's web,
Eagle Soars, Bison runs free,
Thunderbird calls,
Wolf sings high and sweet.
Rest well, my little one.
Ancient legends guard your sleep.

Baby, sweet baby, with tears in your eyes
Rest your head gently, there's no need to cry,
Come let me sing you a soft lullaby
The sandman is coming and dreamland is nigh;
Baby, sweet  baby, with skin soft and fair
And little pink ribbons done up in your hair,
In your tiny world there should not be a care
May angels surround you and send you a prayer;
Baby, sweet baby, your cute button nose
Your soft tiny fingers and sweet baby toes
Have truly bewitched me and nobody knows
How the depth of my love for you just grows and grows;
So precious and tender  your love is to me,
Until I first held you, I never could see
How wonderfully magical my life could be -
You've opened my heart and my spirit is free!
For my sweet little angel Shelby Lynn

Sun soaked revelations
on a patio deck.
I had long forgotten
the simple joys
Of returning to origin.
In its bosom,
the well worn comfort
Of familiarity,
combined with the
clear remembrance
Of lake breeze air.
Every milestone,
And accomplishment,
All seen by the unending tide
Of water in motion.
From the eyes of my window:
the first breath of my brother
and the last sight of my cousin.
The first taste of a woman
and my last meeting with her.
All trials,
Tribulations,
And friendships
Have come, gone
and began again
here.
Lonely winter nights,
The ferocity of the wind off the beach
almost too much to bear.
Nowhere to go,
Except the solace of a guitar,
You taught yourself well back then.
My first car,
Driving around in circles,
a “summer town” deserted in the winter,
And a father
Eager to pass this rite to his son.
Later,
Cracks in a marriage,
like holes in a wall,
and a lonely teenager hoping for the best.
Ultimately,
reconciliation.
My first taste of addiction.
Parents out of town,
I wanted to be the “cool kid”.
A party remembered,
The stench of cigarettes,
Never
Again
Forgotten.
All within these walls.
Outside,
Clear hot air.
I lay back
And gaze deeply
Into the trunk,
of the tree,
I have seen all
My life.
My great aunt used to tell me
that on the branches,
Of this particular tree
Sits a wise old owl.
He will watch over you
During this life.
To a child
An owl shaped branch,
Can give breath quite easily.
Yet I never truly understood
Her message.
Now
That branch is long since gone,
As is she.
And at times when I need her wisdom
Most
I remember the owl.
Today it is clear to me.
Just as the roots
Of a tree anchor
mighty oak,
My home
Anchors me.
I lay back
In my chair.
Feet up,
exhalation.
I am home,
Rooted once again.

She sits on the arenaceous beach
with her legs extended out in front
and her hands behind her back
as she takes in the glorious day.
The borrowed ocean slides off
of her glistening bronze stature
as the sand cushions her long legs
and penetrates her curling toes.
I'd give just about everything I had
just to shrink down to one foot tall;
So I could sit on her luxurious lap
and admire her beauty forever!

Softly and humbly to the Gulf of Arabs
The convoys of dead sailors come;
At night they sway and wander in the waters far under,
But morning rolls them in the foam.
Between the sob and clubbing of the gunfire
Someone, it seems, has time for this,
To pluck them from the shallows and bury them in burrows
And tread the sand upon their nakedness;
And each cross, the driven stake of tidewood,
Bears the last signature of men,
Written with such perplexity, with such bewildered pity,
The words choke as they begin -
'Unknown seaman' - the ghostly pencil
Wavers and fades, the purple drips,
The breath of wet season has washed their inscriptions
As blue as drowned men's lips,
Dead seamen, gone in search of the same landfall,
Whether as enemies they fought,
Or fought with us, or neither; the sand joins them together,
Enlisted on the other front.

Strandbegräbnis
Ergeben und sanft zum Golf der Araber
Kommen die Konvois der toten Matrosen;
Nachts irren sie schwankend im Wasser tief unten,
Doch der Morgen läßt sie im Schaum rollen.
Zwischen dem Schluchzen und Knüppeln von Geschützen
Hat jemand, so scheint es, die Zeit gefunden,
Sie an seichten Stellen aufzusammeln und in Reihen zu begraben
Und den Sand über ihrer Nacktheit festzutreten;
Und jedes Kreuz, ein getriebener Pfahl aus Treibholz,
Trägt die letzte Unterschrift eines Mannes,
Geschrieben mit solcher Bestürzung, mit solch verwirrtem Mitleid,
Die Worte ersticken, sobald sie beginnen -
“Unbekannter Seemann“ - der gespenstische Stift
Zittert und verblaßt, das Purpur tropft,
Der Atem der nassen Jahreszeit hat jede Inschrift
Blau wie die Lippen der Ertrunkenen gefärbt,
Tote Seemänner, fort, denselben Landfall zu suchen,
Wo sie sich als Feinde bekämpft,
Oder mit uns kämpften, oder keines davon, im Sand jetzt zusammen,
Angeworben an der anderen Front.

Paradise is the word,
no other to be called,
a beach like no other
The Sun here is to Shy
Shy! My SunShine
Delray, Delray Beach!
The Paradise...So easy to find...
So dear to me, for so long in my past,
You the Beach I desired...
And there you Are,
Always, day and night,
Beautiful Delray,
Open as no other heart
Safe, protected, Welcoming...
Love, My Beach, My Delray,
The City I call Home!

Palilan, Jimenez, Misamis Ocidental
circa 1996
here
sit on this shore
watch the silver tips
of the rumbling waves
pushed by the wind
who do not hold back
their wings
and forever bidding goodbyes
and forever abandoning my old blues
and are probably concerned

To the beach, my dog and I run,
Play catch frisbees, just for fun.
Umbrella's to block the sun,
Waves crash upon the sand.
My dog chases gulls that try to land. Sky so blue, sand so white,
My dog and I, were up at daylight.
Winds are warm and blowing slight,
Ocean sprays, dog strays,
Sand blows, through our toes. It gets cool, the sun goes down,
My dog and I, head back to town.
It's time we leave the beach to rest.
After all, we were just a guest.
All the birds have flown away.
We will come back, another day.
Just me and my dog, to play.

ON the beach at night alone,
As the old mother sways her to and fro, singing her husky song,
As I watch the bright stars shining--I think a thought of the clef of
the universes, and of the future.
A VAST SIMILITUDE interlocks all,
All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,
comets, asteroids,
All the substances of the same, and all that is spiritual upon the
same,
All distances of place, however wide,
All distances of time--all inanimate forms,
All Souls--all living bodies, though they be ever so different, or in
different worlds,
All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes--the fishes, the
brutes,                                                      10
All men and women--me also;
All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages;
All identities that have existed, or may exist, on this globe, or any
globe;
All lives and deaths--all of the past, present, future;
This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann'd, and shall
forever span them, and compactly hold them, and enclose them.

Birds swimming in the sky
Colours blended with the kite
Beach's gleaming in sandy white
Sun shining a beauty in my eye.
Boats sliding pass sunbather's row
As they gaze up the sky so blue
Images painted on clouds so white
A background to my imaginary flight.
I was there and where were you
Nowhere to perceive but just a shadow,
In the shades of trees and sandy beaches
An image reflected on water's surface,
A mirage of you lost in the shady trees
Lost in the sky's white coloured shades.
In nature and in man's work of wonder
We get lost to find and discover
The truth an image in our mind reveals
As we fly up high and come down our heels.
Out here we lay by the sun's rays,
Counting footsteps on the sandy beaches.

Upon a lonely desart Beach
Where the white foam was scatter'd,
A little shed uprear'd its head
Though lofty Barks were shatter'd.
The Sea-weeds gath'ring near the door,
A sombre path display'd;
And, all around, the deaf'ning roar,
Re-echo'd on the chalky shore,
By the green billows made.
Above, a jutting cliff was seen
Where Sea Birds hover'd, craving;
And all around, the craggs were bound
With weeds- for ever waving.
And here and there, a cavern wide
Its shad'wy jaws display'd;
And near the sands, at ebb of tide,
A shiver'd mast was seen to ride
Where the green billows stray'd.
And often, while the moaning wind
Stole o'er the Summer Ocean;
The moonlight scene, was all serene,
The waters scarce in motion:
Then, while the smoothly slanting sand
The tall cliff wrapp'd in shade,
The Fisherman beheld a band
Of Spectres, gliding hand in hand-
Where the green billows play'd.
And pale their faces were, as snow,
And sullenly they wander'd:
And to the skies with hollow eyes
They look'd as though they ponder'd.
And sometimes, from their hammock shroud,
They dismal howlings made,
And while the blast blew strong and loud
The clear moon mark'd the ghastly croud,
Where the green billows play'd!
And then, above the haunted hut
The Curlews screaming hover'd;
And the low door with furious roar
The frothy breakers cover'd.
For, in the Fisherman's lone shed
A MURDER'D MAN was laid,
With ten wide gashes in his head
And deep was made his sandy bed
Where the green billows play'd.
A Shipwreck'd Mariner was he,
Doom'd from his home to sever;
Who swore to be thro' wind and sea
Firm and undaunted ever!
And when the wave resistless roll'd,
About his arm he made
A packet rich of Spanish gold,
And, like a British sailor, bold,
Plung'd, where the billows play'd!
The Spectre band, his messmates brave
Sunk in the yawning ocean,
While to the mast he lash'd him fast
And brav'd the storm's commotion.
The winter moon, upon the sand
A silv'ry carpet made,
And mark'd the Sailor reach the land,
And mark'd his murd'rer wash his hand
Where the green billows play'd.
And since that hour the Fisherman
Has toil'd and toil'd in vain!
For all the night, the moony light
Gleams on the specter'd main!
And when the skies are veil'd in gloom,
The Murd'rer's liquid way
Bounds o'er the deeply yawning tomb,
And flashing fires the sands illume,
Where the green billows play!
Full thirty years his task has been,
Day after day more weary;
For Heav'n design'd, his guilty mind
Should dwell on prospects dreary.
Bound by a strong and mystic chain,
He has not pow'r to stray;
But, destin'd mis'ry to sustain,
He wastes, in Solitude and Pain-
A loathsome life away.

I walked to the cliff top to watch the sunset
thinking of you and the time that we met
I watched as the sun drifted down from the sky
a reminding reflection of light in your eyes
A myriad birds flocked from over the hill
returning to roost as the world stood still
their fawning and waving high up in the air
brought memories to me how you unfurl your hair
The sea seemed to amble as if in a trance
when reaching the rocks leaping into a dance
its light sparking rainbows in fine misty haze
a lasting encounter of how we embrace
The sun kissed the horizon like I kiss your lips
it was saying goodnight with its light fingertips
caressing the ocean and stretching my way
a beautiful end to a beautiful day.

Beautiful Balmermo on the bonnie banks of Tay,
It's a very bonnie spot in the months of June or May;
The scenery there is charming and fascinating to see,
Especially the surroundings of the old Abbey,
Which is situated in the midst of trees on a rugged hill,
Which visitors can view at their own free will;
And the trees and shrubberies are lovely to view,
Especially the trees on each side of the avenue
Which leads up to the Abbey amongst the trees;
And in the summer time it's frequented with bees,
And also crows with their unmusical cry,
Which is a great annoyance to the villagers that live near by.
And there in the summer season the mavis sings,
And with her charming notes the woodland rings;
And the sweet-scented zephyrs is borne upon the gale,
Which is most refreshing and invigorating to inhale.
Then there's the stately Castle of Balmerino
Situated in the midst of trees, a magnificent show,
And bordering on the banks o' the silvery Tay,
Where visitors can spend a happy holiday.
As they view the castle and scenery around
It will help to cheer their spirits I'll be bound;
And if they wish to view Wormit Bay
They can walk along the braes o' the silvery Tay.

frost bitten rain drop
watched by crystal eyes
spinning in whirl-winds
dancing across still skies
loved by many
across the feilds it flies
but even with the beauty
a broken heart dies

North Berwick is a watering-place with golfing links green,
With a fine bathing beach most lovely to be seen;
And there's a large number of handsome villas also,
And often it's called the Scarborough of Scotland, as Portobello.
The greatest attraction is Tantallon Castle, worthy of regard,
About three miles distant to the eastward;
Which in time of war reoeived many a shock,
And it's deemed impregnable and built on a perpendicular rock
The castle was built in times unknown to history,
But 'tis said it belonged to the Douglas family;
And the inside is a labyrinth of broken staircases,
Also ruined chambers and many dismal places.
Then there's the Berwick Law Hill, 612 feet high,
Which no doubt is very attractive to the eye,
And skirted with a wood and a public walk,
Where visitors can enjoy themselves and have a social talk.
The wood is really lovely and enchanting to be seen,
In the spring or summer season when the trees are green;
And as ye listen to the innocent birds singing merrily there,
'Twill help to elevate your spirits and drive away dull care.
Then near by Tantallon is the fishing village of Canty Bay,
Where boats can be hired to the Bass Rock, about two miles away;
And the surrounding scenery is magnificent to see,
And as the tourists view the scene it fills their hearts with glee.
Then away! then away! pleasure-seekers in bands,
And view Gullane with its beautiful sands,
Which stretch along the sandy shores of Fife,
Where the tourist can enjoy himself and be free from strife.

The village of Penicuik, with its neighbouring spinning mills,
Is most lovely to see, and the Pentland Hills;
And though of a barren appearance and some parts steep,
They are covered with fine pasture and sustain flocks of sheep.
There, tourists while there should take a good look,
By viewing the surrounding beauties of Penicuik;
About three miles south-west is the romantic locality
Of Newhall, which is most fascinating and charming to see.
Then about half a mile above Newhall the River Esk is seen,
Which sparkles like crystal in the sun's sheen;
And on the Esk there's a forking ridge forming a linn
Betwixt two birch trees, which makes a noisy din.
And on a rocky protuberance close by is Mary Stuart's bower
Where Scotland's ill-starred Queen spent many an hour,
Which is composed of turf and a nice round seat
Commanding a full view of the linn- the sight is quite a treat.
Then there's Habbie's Howe, where the beauties of summer grow,
Which cannot be excelled in Scotland for pastoral show;
Tis one of the most beautiful landscapes in fair Scotland,
For the scenery there is most charming and grand.
Then ye tourists to the village of Penicuik haste away,
And there spend the lovely summer day
By climbing the heathy, barren Pentland Hills,
And drink the pure water from their crystal rills.

i woke up
my body was cold
i climbed off the bed
i tried not to fall
i couldnt see
everything was a blur
i remember being beat
before i reached unconciesness
i heard them speak
they talked of blood
and the next chapter to
the book of shadows
i felt the blade
but it didnt hurt
i couldnt speak
maybe i couldnt even breathe
all i know is right now im in the hospital
laying in the bed
i hear the breathing machine behind me buzz inside my head
who makes the decision?

All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful,
The Lord God made them all.
Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colours,
He made their tiny wings.
The rich man in his castle,
The poor man at his gate,
God made them, high or lowly,
And ordered their estate.
The purple-headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset, and the morning,
That brightens up the sky;
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one.
The tall trees in the greenwood,
The meadows where we play,
The rushes by the water,
We gather every day;--
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell,
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.

Gloomy faces in grocery stores
Traverse the aisles of the vegetables.
No one seems happy plotting out
And paying for their sustenance,
But personally, I adore
Every bag of gorgeously orange carrots
And the lovely dark green broccoli.
And how divine to see Italian wine
Or recently baked apple pies,
Sometimes I can’t believe my eyes
To be in such a beautiful place!
In reverence I bow my head,
I can’t wait to go home and say my prayers
And break my bread.

I go to bed in Los Angeles thinking
about you.

Ah whither, Love, wilt thou now carry me?
What wontless fury dost thou now inspire
Into my feeble breast, too full of thee?
Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire,
Thou in me kindlest much more great desire,
And up aloft above my strength dost raise
The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.
That as I erst in praise of thine own name,
So now in honour of thy mother dear,
An honourable hymn I eke should frame,
And with the brightness of her beauty clear,
The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear
To admiration of that heavenly light,
From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.
Thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty,
Mother of love, and of all world's delight,
Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty
Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,
Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light
T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,
And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:
That both to thee, to whom I mean it most,
And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam
Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,
That now it wasted is with woes extreme,
It may so please, that she at length will stream
Some dew of grace into my withered heart,
After long sorrow and consuming smart.
WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast
To make all things such as we now behold,
It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd
A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould
He fashion'd them as comely as he could;
That now so fair and seemly they appear,
As nought may be amended anywhere.
That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,
Whether in earth laid up in secret store,
Or else in heaven, that no man may it see
With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,
Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore;
Whose face and feature doth so much excel
All mortal sense, that none the same may tell.
Thereof as every earthly thing partakes
Or more or less, by influence divine,
So it more fair accordingly it makes,
And the gross matter of this earthly mine,
Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,
Doing away the dross which dims the light
Of that fair beam which therein is empight.
For, through infusion of celestial power,
The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,
And lifeful spirits privily doth pour
Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight
They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,
O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam
Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.
That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace
To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,
Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,
Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,
And robs the hearts of those which it admire;
Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,
That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.
How vainly then do idle wits invent,
That beauty is nought else but mixture made
Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament
Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade
And pass away, like to a summer's shade;
Or that it is but comely composition
Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.
Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,
That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,
And therein stir such rage and restless stour,
As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?
Or can proportion of the outward part
Move such affection in the inward mind,
That it can rob both sense and reason blind?
Why do not then the blossoms of the field,
Which are array'd with much more orient hue,
And to the sense most dainty odours yield,
Work like impression in the looker's view?
Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,
In which oft-times we nature see of art
Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?
But ah, believe me, there is more than so,
That works such wonders in the minds of men;
I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,
And whoso list the like assays to ken,
Shall find by trial, and confess it then,
That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,
An outward shew of things, that only seem.
For that same goodly hue of white and red,
With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,
And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread
Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away
To that they were, even to corrupted clay;
That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,
Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.
But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray
That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,
Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;
But when the vital spirits do expire,
Unto her native planet shall retire;
For it is heavenly born and cannot die,
Being a parcel of the purest sky.
For when the soul, the which derived was,
At first, out of that great immortal Spright,
By whom all live to love, whilom did pass
Down from the top of purest heaven's height
To be embodied here, it then took light
And lively spirits from that fairest star,
Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.
Which power retaining still or more or less,
When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,
Through every part she doth the same impress,
According as the heavens have her graced,
And frames her house, in which she will be placed,
Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil
Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.
Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have
The most resemblance of that heavenly light,
Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave
Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,
And the gross matter by a sovereign might
Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen
A palace fit for such a virgin queen.
So every spirit, as it is most pure,
And hath in it the more of heavenly light,
So it the fairer body doth procure
To habit in, and it more fairly dight
With cheerful grace and amiable sight.
For of the soul the body form doth take:
For soul is form, and doth the body make.
Therefore wherever that thou dost behold
A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,
Know this for certain, that the same doth hold
A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,
Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.
For all that fair is, is by nature good;
That is a sign to know the gentle blood.
Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind
Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,
Either by chance, against the course of kind,
Or through unaptness in the substance found,
Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,
That will not yield unto her form's direction,
But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.
And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)
That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,
Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,
Which doth the world with her delight adorn,
Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,
Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,
But every one doth seek but to deprave it.
Yet nathëmore is that fair beauty's blame,
But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:
Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame
May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:
Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,
However flesh{"e}s fault it filthy make;
For things immortal no corruption take.
But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments
And lively images of heaven's light,
Let not your beams with such disparagements
Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;
But mindful still of your first country's sight,
Do still preserve your first informed grace,
Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.
Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,
Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,
That base affections, which your ears would bland,
Commend to you by love's abused name,
But is indeed the bondslave of defame;
Which will the garland of your glory mar,
And quench the light of your bright shining star.
But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,
Will more illumine your resplendent ray,
And add more brightness to your goodly hue,
From light of his pure fire; which, by like way
Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;
Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,
Do both express the face's first impression.
Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,
It you behoves to love, and forth to lay
That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,
That men the more admire their fountain may;
For else what booteth that celestial ray,
If it in darkness be enshrined ever,
That it of loving eyes be viewed never?
But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,
That likest to yourselves ye them select,
The which your forms' first source may sympathize,
And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;
For, if you loosely love without respect,
It is no love, but a discordant war,
Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.
For love is a celestial harmony
Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,
Which join together in sweet sympathy,
To work each other's joy and true content,
Which they have harbour'd since their first descent
Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see
And know each other here belov'd to be.
Then wrong it were that any other twain
Should in love's gentle band combined be
But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,
And made out of one mould the more t' agree;
For all that like the beauty which they see,
Straight do not love; for love is not so light
As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.
But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,
With pure regard and spotless true intent,
Drawing out of the object of their eyes
A more refined form, which they present
Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;
Which it reducing to her first perfection,
Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.
And then conforming it unto the light,
Which in itself it hath remaining still,
Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,
Thereof he fashions in his higher skill
An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;
And it embracing in his mind entire,
The mirror of his own thought doth admire.
Which seeing now so inly fair to be,
As outward it appeareth to the eye,
And with his spirit's proportion to agree,
He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,
And fully setteth his felicity;
Counting it fairer than it is indeed,
And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.
For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be
Than other men's, and in dear love's delight
See more than any other eyes can see,
Through mutual receipt of beam{"e}s bright,
Which carry privy message to the spright,
And to their eyes that inmost fair display,
As plain as light discovers dawning day.
Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,
Armies of loves still flying to and fro,
Which dart at them their little fiery lances;
Whom having wounded, back again they go,
Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;
Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,
Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.
In which how many wonders do they rede
To their conceit, that others never see,
Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,
Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;
Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;
But when her words' embássade forth she sends,
Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.
Sometimes upon her forehead they behold
A thousand graces masking in delight;
Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold
Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight
Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;
But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,
So many millions of chaste pleasures play.
All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more
Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,
To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,
That may it more to mortal eyes commend,
And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:
That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,
And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.
Then Iö, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,
Advance the banner of thy conquest high,
That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,
May draw to thee, and with due fealty
Adore the power of thy great majesty,
Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,
Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.
In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,
That she whose conquering beauty doth captive
My trembling heart in her eternal chain,
One drop of grace at length will to me give,
That I her bounden thrall by her may live,
And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,
May owe to her, of whom I it received.
And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,
Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,
When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,
Deign to let fall one drop of due relief,
That may recure my heart's long pining grief,
And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,
That can restore a damned wight from death.

I was a 20 year old unemployed receptionist with dyed orange dreadlocks sprouting out of my skull. I needed a job, but first, I needed a haircut.
So I head for this beauty salon on Avenue B.
I'm gonna get a hairdo.
I'm gonna look just like those hot Spanish haircut models, become brown and bodacious, grow some 7 inch fingernails painted bitch red and rake them down the chalkboard of the job market's soul.
So I go in the beauty salon.
This beautiful Puerto Rican girl in tight white spandex and a push-up bra sits me down and starts chopping my hair:
"Girlfriend," she says, "what the hell you got growing outta your head there, what is that, hair implants? Yuck, you want me to touch that shit, whadya got in there, sandwiches?"
I just go: "I'm sorry."
She starts snipping my carefully cultivated Johnny Lydon post-Pistols hairdo. My foul little dreadlocks are flying around all over the place but I'm not looking in the mirror cause I just don't want to know.
"So what's your name anyway?" My stylist demands then.
"Uh, Maggie."
"Maggie? Well, that's an okay name, but my name is Suzy."
"Yeah, so?"
"Yeah so it ain't just Suzy S.U.Z.Y, I spell it S.U.Z.E.E, the extra "e" is for extra Suzee."
I nod emphatically.
Suzee tells me when she's not busy chopping hair, she works as an exotic dancer at night to support her boyfriend named Rocco. Suzee loves Rocco, she loves him so much she's got her eyes closed as she describes him:
"6 foot 2, 193 pounds and, girlfriend, his arms so big and long they wrap around me twice like I'm a little Suzee sandwich."
Little Suzee Sandwich is rapt, she blindly snips and clips at my poor punk head. She snips and clips and snips and clips, she pauses, I look in the mirror: "Holy shit, I'm bald."
"Holy shit, baby, you're bald." Suzee says, finally opening her eyes and then gasping.
All I've got left is little post-nuke clumps of orange fuzz. And I'll never get a receptionist job now.
But Suzy waves her manicured finger in my face: "Don't you worry, baby, I'm gonna get you a job at the dancing club."
"What?"
" ;Baby, let me tell you, the boys are gonna like a bald go go dancer."
That said, she whips out some clippers, shaves my head smooth and insists I'm gonna love getting naked for a living.
None of this sounds like my idea of a good time, but I'm broke and I'm bald so I go home and get my best panties. Suzee lends me some 6 inch pumps, paints my lips bright red, and gives me 7 shots of Jack Daniels to relax me.
8pm that night I take the stage.
I'm bald,
I'm drunk,
and by god,
I'm naked.
HOLY SHIT I'M NAKED IN A ROOM FULL OF STRANGERS THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE RECURRING NIGHTMARES WE ALL HAVE ABOUT BEING BUTT NAKED IN PUBLIC, I AM NAKED, I DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE, THIS REALLY SUCKS.
A few guys feel sorry for me and risk getting their hands bitten off by sticking dollars in my garter belt. My disheveled pubic hairs stand at full attention, ready to poke the guys' eyes out if they get too close.
Then I notice this bald guy in the audience, I've got a new empathy for bald people, I figure maybe it works both ways, maybe this guy will stick 10 bucks in my garter.
I saunter over.
I'm teetering around unrhythmically, I'm the surliest, unsexiest dancer that ever go-go across this hemisphere. The bald guy looks down into his beer, he'd much rather look at that than at my pubic mound which has now formed into one vicious spike so it looks like I've got a unicorn in my crotch.
I stand there weaving through the air.
The strobe light is illuminating my pubic unicorn. Madonna's song Borderline is pumping through the club's speaker system for the 5th time tonight: "BORDERLINE BORDERLINE BORDERLINE/LOVE ME TIL I JUST CAN'T SEE." And suddenly, I start to wonder: What does that mean anyway?
"LOVE ME TIL I JUST CAN'T SEE"
What?
Screw me so much my eyes pop out, I go blind, end up walking down 2nd Avenue crazy, horny, naked and blind? What?
There's a glitch in the tape and it starts to skip.
"Borderl...ooop.....Borderl.... ooop...Borderlin.....ooop"
I stumble and twist my ankle. My g-string rides between my buttcheeks making me twitch with pain. My head starts spinning, my knees wobble, I go down on all fours and puke all over the bald guy's lap.
So there I am. Butt naked on all fours. But before I have time to regain my composure, the strip club manager comes over, points his smarmy strip club manager finger at me and goes:
"You're bald, you're drunk, you can't dance and you're fired."
I stand up.
"Oh yeah, well you stink like a sneaker, pal." I peel off one of my pumps and throw it in the direction of his fat head then I get the hell out of there.
A few days later I run into Suzee on Avenue A. Turns out she got fired for getting me a job there in the first place. But she was completely undaunted, she dragged me up to this wig store on 14th Street, bought me a mouse brown shag wig, then got us both telemarketing jobs on Wall Street.
And I never went to a beauty salon again.

The beautiful, the fair, the elegant,
Is that which pleases us, says Kant,
Without a thought of interest or advantage.
I used to watch men when they spoke of beauty
And measure their enthusiasm. One
An old man, seeing a ( ) setting sun,
Praised it ( ) a certain sense of duty
To the calm evening and his time of life.
I know another man that never says a Beauty
But of a horse; ( )
Men seldom speak of beauty, beauty as such,
Not even lovers think about it much.
Women of course consider it for hours
In mirrors; ( )
A shrapnel ball -
Just where the wet skin glistened when he swam -
Like a fully-opened sea-anemone.
We both said 'What a beauty! What a beauty, lad'
I knew that in that flower he saw a hope
Of living on, and seeing again the roses of his home.
Beauty is that which pleases and delights,
Not bringing personal advantage - Kant.
But later on I heard
A canker worked into that crimson flower
And that he sank with it
And laid it with the anemones off Dover.

Beauty comes within.
Not within the heart
But further, beauty within the soul.
If you look deep inside the soul
That beauty will be there.
It's a beautiful thing to see
If you're lucky enough to see it.
It's not on my face.
Not in the eyes.
Nor on the body.
The beauty is in my soul.
Always remember that.
I may not be pretty
nor skinny.
My beauty is below my heart, in my soul.
So if you take the time
And look depper
You'll see the beauty I see!

As if chiseled, a fruit-laden branch
Hangs in my garden, asleep - so low...
The trees sleep - and dream? - in moonlight;
And the mystery of their life is near, near...
Even if we cannot grasp it,
The mute language is still intelligible:
They use our beauty to express
How we are one amidst rays and spots of light.
And the tremor of any life's creation
Reveals itself in a lovely form;
And the variance of different things is sweetened
By shared beauty. Multiply it!
And the world will be like this unstirring garden,
Where everything heeds a harmonious silence:
Both stem and flower yield to the dear Earth;
Both flower and stem listen to the Moon.

I died for beauty, but was scarce
Adjusted in the tomb,
When one who died for truth was lain
In an adjoining room.
He questioned softly why I failed?
"For beauty," I replied.
"And I for truth - the two are one;
We brethren are," he said.
And so, as kinsmen met a-night,
We talked between the rooms,
Until the moss had reached our lips,
And covered up our names.

Blest be the dawn, the luminous blue-slate,
the arch transfused by the glorious sun,
and blackbirds chanting hymnals in prickly bushes,
and rooks high over fields coughing up love.
Blest be the winds about the furrowed brow,
and the joyful whispers of dying leaves,
the maples staggered blissfully behind barbed fences
above the tombs of the newly redeemed.
Blest be pain that comes like a stark beggar,
the thorn-tree that has its roots in a star,
the sweet massacred gourds tethered to the rusting gate,
the apples heaped on the agonized floor.

Snowdrop of dogs, with ear of brownest dye,
Like the last orphan leaf of naked tree
Which shudders in black autumn; though by thee,
Of hearing careless and untutored eye,
Not understood articulate speech of men
Nor marked the artificial mind of books,
-The mortal's voice eternized by the pen,-
Yet hast thou thought and language all unknown
To Babel's scholars; oft intensest looks,
Long scrutiny over some dark-veined stone
Dost thou bestow, learning dead mysteries
Of the world's birth-day, oft in eager tone
With quick-tailed fellows bandiest prompt replies,
Solicitudes canine, four-footed amities.

I BADE, because the wick and oil are spent
And frozen are the channels of the blood,
My discontented heart to draw content
From beauty that is cast out of a mould
In bronze, or that in dazzling marble appears,
Appears, but when wc have gone is gone again,
Being more indifferent to our solitude
Than 'twere an apparition.  O heart, we are old;
The living beauty is for younger men:
We cannot pay its rribute of wild tears.

Everyone needs a reason to believe.
To believe in God,
their family and friends,
their wife and their life.
Without having a reason,
life could never carry on,
but having a reason to believe
means anything you want,
you can go out and achieve.
(7 October 2007)

do you believe that,
you became every thing in my life..
do you believe that,
i care about you and missed you every moment..
do you believe that,
i need and want to be near to you every night..
do you believe that,
i love every one who is like you in face and a voice and a smile...
do you believe that,
i suffer so much in your leaving and never to take a breathe well...
do you believe that,
i afraid from my eyes to show up me that i love you...
do you believe that,
i become jealous from any air goes around your neck...
do you believe that,
i loved you and never loved one as you..
believe me that,
i love you...

Believe your hesitations
Don’t hesitate over your beliefs
You will find your way
The way of Lord whom you pray
(2008/1/23)

Girl, do not believe his stories
They are all full of lies
Keep standing up for him
Tears will fall from your eyes
Remove yourself from him
That is what you need to do
He does not really love you
He just thrives on using you

I believe in having good friends
They keep you up to date
With the latest fashion trends
I believe in telling jokes
I want to laugh regularly
Until I choke
I believe in being serious
There is always an air
Of you being mysterious
Even if there is nothing there
I believe in good sex
It is a good form of exercise
Even though it can be complex
I believe in love
Be it from down below
Or heaven-sent from above
I believe in fate
It is not something you create
It just happens out of the sudden
I believe in luck
But only when it works
When it doesn’t I just mock
I believe in hard work
Not only talk, talk, talk
It is work that earns you the buck
I believe in you
But sometimes do wonder
If all the things you say are true
I believe in good food
Spiced with romance after
To lighten up the mood
I believe in making babies
Then turning them
To gentlemen and ladies
I believe in courage
Strength with sense and not rage
I believe in dreams
But not the ones that make you scream
I believe in God
No ones knowledge and power
Is that vastly broad
And last of all
I believe in me
If I stopped believing
Then life’s wonderful gifts
Would not be worth receiving

“I could write the saddest poems tonight”
A stolen verse from the saddest poem I ever read
And think once he was mine
And now that is in the past
That He left my soul destroyed
Now I don’t believe in love
Once I was in love, and it was nice
A consolation prize the memories
Of the sweetest kiss I had received
The day he stole one from me
Only God knows if he loves me once?
I simply have the anguish to figure out
Whether once he loves me or not
The sun sees me and hides from me
I only get thistle from the field
The same field that gave me roses
When I proposed to him
Countless stars on that ebony sky
The only thing that now I have
Meanwhile I’m lost in this fogy land
I’m starting to believe:
That no one ever will love to me
Spanish, Creo

I can't believe  that you're single
Your personality blooms like a flower
And your face is so beautiful
That you cause mirrors to grow legs
Just so that they can be a reflection of you

I now understand but still I can't believe,
the things I hear or see
I jus don't know what to do,
the things I hear and see
my eyes still won't let my heart believe,
I've opened up but I now I think I should close her down,
she can't go threw anymore pain...
I now understand but still I can't believe,
that everything I've been threw
and u really don't care about me
I jus don't know why are u here if ur not here for me,
maybe its jus to toy with me heart and see how much it bleeds
I've been throw to much to jus let u run all over my heart like that....
I now understand but still can't believe,
why no how could u do this to me
I've given u my all and this is how u say thanks
by crushing my heart and soul,
by leaving them to bleed so that some other person can't save them...
I now understand but still can't believe,
that it was never only me....it was she..her but never we........

You think that I just love to mope,
To mope, despond, cry & grieve.
But I see just you as my hope,
I trust you – yet do not believe.
You tell me a regular story –
Too fabulous for to perceive,
Too fabulous for me, I’m sorry…
I trust you but cannot believe.
Though I cannot call you a liar
Per se I expect you to leave
In doubts my soul, my fen-fire,
I trust you but hardly believe.
I used to rise then break in flinders,
I wear my heart on my sleeve.
Is it your or my flame that cinders?
I trust you but should I believe?
A hedgehog am I – cut my stickers
For waves in my hot chest to heave
So calm while my butterfly flickers,
I trust you and want to believe!

She'll love you 'til her dying day,
and just to prove it
she'll take it out regularly on her Mom,
frequently on her sisters,
and later, sometimes on her partner.
You got yourself a deal.

Flower buds sleep,
hiding dreams inside.
Universe rests in grain of pollen.
When dawn touches,
by golden quill dipped in dew,
life wakes up afresh.
Divine breeze kisses soft,
Lips slight apart aghast.
Heaven slides down,
tongue twists exotic.
Drama of life unfolds,
as sun wakes up full.
Five petals spread far n’ wide,
trek every nook n’ corner,
acts in scenes of desire.
Time sinks in ocean infinite,
fishing out dead hopes.
Sun dives down in coma.
Mind floats dead in dead-sea.
Retirement arrives unaware.
Lying on a rickety cot,
life unknown, stretches frozen.
Day falls deep into nightmare.
faded petals retreat to dust.
One by one teeth fall.
Skin wrinkles. Tongue bites.
Eyes closes, as ears go blank.
Body remains among discarded flowers.
Life stinks, delves deep into abysses,
Off to another birth another time.
into dirt and filths again.

… birth of a day
An endlessness, gifted:
maddening passion
wrapped in blue, red and green
to make love to the  enormity of littleness…[]
moments wanted to be married  [moments which…]
but time not yet born…
thirst frozen-steaming cup of coffee
time alive-the clock on the wall dead
so many tomorrows- today has for us
A new moon day …
…in the nights of these -each living…
Dear endless sky-never shall you be walking in the dark
Without the stars-
…so far gone…
…still the fragrance from the empty bottle of perfume lingering in and around
Wherever I go…

Before we knew
anything at all about sex
we knew
all about our birth
stories.
Our Mam
would recall & regale us all
(setting the table...peeling spuds...sweeping out the hall)
with the intimate
details
of all
our births.
“Tell us of US again...Mam...tell of us again! ”
I was small
(2lbs 2 ounces)
hardly anything
at all.
A mere scrap of
human being.
Blathin Ashling
was even smaller
(1 lb something or other)
...a little miracle.
Was it Deirdre
with the cord wrapped
around her neck
fighting both
Life & Death
‘til she was blue
In the face
Or Grainne
with the cord so thin
she was born just in
the nick of time
& the cord(just a hair’s
breath)
floats eternally now
(in a glass of formaldehyde  still)
for doctors to astonish
& marvel at.
And how
there being no incubators
when I came into being
they had to wrap
me up
in cotton wool
(as if I were a
precious thing)
in order to keep
me warm
but I wasn’t having
any of it
kicking my way
out of the stuff
only for them
to repackage
me again!
And again...& again.
And here(in 1956)
I arrive on the scene
tip toeing out into
Life
with cool coal black
full length sideburns
ready to rock
& roll man
as the labour ward radio
played
the hit
of the day
“CE SERA...SERA! ”
It’s almost as if
I can still hear
Doris singing
our whatevers
will bes.
Our birth
story
each our
first fairy story
& we
the Prince & Princesses
of it
all.

Mark the day white, on which the Fates have smiled:
Eugenio and Egeria have a child.
On whom abundant grace kind Jove imparts
If she but copy either parent's parts.
Then, Muses! long devoted to her race,
Grant her Egeria's virtues and her face;
Nor stop your bounty there, but add to it
Eugenio's learning and Eugenio's wit.

When you were born, beloved, was your soul
New made by God to match your body's flower,
And were they both at one same precious hour
Sent forth from heaven as a perfect whole?
Or had your soul since dim creation burned,
A star in some still region of the sky,
That leaping earthward, left its place on high
And to your little new-born body yearned?
No words can tell in what celestial hour
God made your soul and gave it mortal birth,
Nor in the disarray of all the stars
Is any place so sweet that such a flower
Might linger there until thro' heaven's bars,
It heard God's voice that bade it down to earth.

At the creation of the Earth
Pleasure, that divinest birth,
From the soil of Heaven did rise,
Wrapped in sweet wild melodies--
Like an exhalation wreathing
To the sound of air low-breathing
Through Aeolian pines, which make
A shade and shelter to the lake
Whence it rises soft and slow;
Her life-breathing [limbs] did flow
In the harmony divine
Of an ever-lengthening line
Which enwrapped her perfect form
With a beauty clear and warm.

Terrorists struck without warning!
Coming out of a clear blue sky
On a beautiful cool morning,
Leaving us to wonder why
They’d kill women and children,
Muslim, Buddhist and Jew,
Hindu, Shinto and Christian,
To name only a few...
One brother against another,
We aren’t so different at birth
Teaching makes us hate each other
And lessens our own self worth...
Hatred begets hatred,
Your victory is to make more like you,
But in the end you’re dead
And “Victory” is dust and ashes, too
Yes, terrorists struck without seeing,
Killing all in their blindness,
But the most meaningful responses
Were random acts of kindness....

His ears are ever vigilant be careful of what you do say
Big Brother he is listening from you he's never far away
Your words he may put a slant on and one word in the wrong place
Could see you in deep trouble the court you might have to face.
The Government allows free speech free to a point maybe
But when mere words can land you in trouble that does not seem free to me
And big brother is listening and he hears what he wants to hear
The best way of freedom curtailment is the weapon known as fear
And big brother he takes note every time you speak your mind
And if he sees something he does not like in trouble yourself you will find
He is the Government watchdog your words can see you in jail
Big brother is always watching you he even checks your mail.
Big brother he is listening even when your friends you phone
And even those who live on their own in truth are not alone
For big brother is with them though him they cannot see
He remains as invisible and few as treacherous as he.

Brother Brother
Please Come Back Home
I Wish We All Would Have Known
Brother Brother
Why Arent You Here?
You Diddnt Have Anything To Fear
Things Would Have Gotten Better
Throught This Past Painful Year
You Took Your Own Life Brother
Just Like So Many Others
Your Family Just Looks At Pictures And Has To Stare
Thats The Only Way We See You And Its Just  Not Fair
We All Miss Your Big Smile
That You Had On Your Face Every Day
I Love You Sister
The Words You Said Every Single Day
I Miss The Way You HUgged Me
The Way You Would Always Be There
Now Once Again All I Do Is sit and Stare

Someone who wants to be a rocker
Known as my brother
Always playing guitar.
So annoying
Drives me crazy
Tell him to get up
Because he's lazy.
Pretending to be
Someone he's not
Nothing wrong with that
But please at eleven at night
Let's get some shut eye
And turn off the light.
*(For you my brother, For there is no other) *

You were still my brother
no matter what you did
or how you lived
and I loved you.
We were not as close
in latter years
as we were
when we were younger.
I wish you were here
so I could hold you
one last time
before you had to go.
The last time I saw you
you looked so very cold.
(Dedicated To The Memory Of my Brother
Who Died Last Year)
(2000)

On a special delayed morning
When I was still snoring
My mom was taken to the hospital
For she was a very pregnant lady
She returned home with a gift
A gift I still cherish
For she brought home for me, a brother
A cute and cuddly li’l baby you
Your baby steps trodden my mind
And each time you trip,
I made sure to catch you
Your blinking eyes were baby blue
Scribbled with many forget-me-nots
Your hugs were tempting
It comforted me
Your soft kisses
Were heavenly sent!
I stayed by you
In the days you grew
I gazed to see
What a man you’ll be
I walked like a shadow
Tracing your each step
I wanted to guide you
Through your wrongs and mistakes
I’ll miss this angel
In years to come
For you’ll be busy
With work to do
I write this poem here, right now
‘Coz this is my only way
To show how much I love you
To prove that I care!
(WRITTEN FOR A BROTHER I ALWAYS WISHED TO HAVE)

My brother
Is my son
He is my elder brother
And yet
He is
My smallest
Brother
Still!

My sweet brother…! ! !
I am blessed with a sweet little brother,
And I am thankful to god that he didn’t give me someone other,
We went to the same school,
And had our food in the same dining room,
Books had been his greatest enemies,
But he had to study because there was no other remedy,
Red marks were prominent in his result,
But still he never took them as an insult,
He believed in being playful,
And this was the only thing which he considered to be useful…! !
But now he is a grown up guy,
Who doesn’t like toys and is not shy,
He is the one with whom I can share,
And he listens to me and never ever stares,
He cannot see a tear in my eye,
And this makes me feel not to give up and to try forever,
He has now become very responsible,
And I know if he gets the support he is very capable,
He is self obsessed with his looks,
And convinces us either by hook or by crook…! !
I am gonna get married in a while,
And I know he has already decided about the style,
As he is there I am not worried about my mom,
Because I know his care and love will make her strong,
I am sorry for my mistakes,
But I love you to the core and this is one thing which no one can
take…! !
Love you bhai….thanks for supporting me….! !

None lives for ever, brother, and
nothing lasts for long. Keep that in
mind and rejoice.
Our life is not the one old burden,
our path is not the one long
journey.
One sole poet has not to sing one
aged song.
The flower fades and dies; but he
who wears the flower has not to
mourn for it for ever.
Brother, keep that in mind and
rejoice.
There must come a full pause to
weave perfection into music.
Life droops toward its sunset to be
drowned in the golden shadows.
Love must be called from its play
to drink sorrow and be borne to the
heaven of tears.
Brother, keep that in min and
rejoice.
We hasten to gather our flowers lest
they are plundered by the passing
winds.
It quickens our blood and brightens
our eyes to snatch kisses that would
vanish if we delayed.
Our life is eager, our desires are keen,
for time tolls the bell of parting.
Brother, keep that in mind and
rejoice.
There is not time for us to clasp a
thing and crush it and fling it away to
the dust.
The hours trip rapidly away, hiding
their dreams in their skirts.
Our life is short; it yields but a
few days for love.
Were it for work and drudgery it
would be endlessly long.
Brother, keep that in mind and
rejoice.
Beauty is sweet to us, because she
dances to the same fleeting tune with
our lives.
Knowledge is precious to us, because
we shall never have time to
complete it.
All is done and finished in the eternal
Heaven.
But earth's flowers of illusion are
kept eternally fresh by death.
Brother, keep that in mind and
rejoice.

What is a brother?
Someone who is there
when you are hurting
He picks you up
and dusts you off again
What is a brother?
Someone who sees you are without a smile
And he gives you one of his
and gives you a hug too
just especially for you
What is a brother?
Someone who stands by your side
and holds your hand
when things don’t go well
He helps you understand
What is a brother?
A cherished friend for life
a brother by blood
A cousin or friend
But always by love

A Romantic Dialogue
The Butterfly:
"O Bright Sunflower! How handsome you are!
Can I come and sit on your yellow petals?
Your sparkling luminosity makes me bounce with happiness,
Your golden hue makes me fly in circles with joyfulness,
Your symmetrical centre filled with seeds is, verily, blessedness! "
The Sun Flower:
"O Beautiful Butterfly! You are my muse!
No! Not the dazzling Sun who dazzles from a distant,
But You! My pretty Butterfly!
You are flitting around me all the time,
Playing and parading your shining wings,
Swinging and springing like a belly dancer!
Come! Let us dance and waltz around!
Or would you prefer to dance the Tango?
There is not much time for us to waste,
The sun will set by evening! Make haste!
You are here only for a day! Not more!
We are a perfect match,
Attired in glowing yellow shades,
Before the Sun drops his curtain,
Embrace me with your golden wings.! "

The dreams of my heart
my mind doth pass
In my dream of butterflys
for they hug me
without sound
Nothing stays with me to long
In my dream of butterflys
they lift me from this ground
But I have had from
since as a child
In my dream of butterflys
they so still my mind
The deep solace of song
In my dream of butterflys
they flutter for there posied.
In my dream of butterflys
my daughter now is four
If that should ever leave me
In my dream of butterflys
such delight my eyes
forever roam
Let me find life and stay
In my dream of butterflys
soft weaved wings
they always have
With wings whose tunes
are played out and not
forgotten
In my dream of butterflys
linen is does my neice now lay.
Like the rain of yesterday
rainbow weaved it is
thus so
In my dream of butterflys
heavens light doth shine
so true.
In my dream of butterflys
no cut nor sting
for all will sing
for the beauty with
out flowers no dream.

Butterfly; butterfly fly away,
teach me how to be as free as free can be.
Butterfly; butterfly I see you there,
its beautiful the way your wings caress the air.
Butterfly; butterfly go as high as you can go,
show me the things that I don't yet know.
Butterfly; butterfly fly into the sky,
dropp down and land yourself by my side.
Butterfly; butterfly I see you kiss a flower,
my eyes fill and I begin to ponder.
Butterfly; butterfly your beauty soars,
I see the beauty in you and I see the beauty within me.
Butterfly; butterfly show me the way,
For beauty is beautiful but there's more to me.
Butterfly; butterfly show yourself,
I see your colors and I see your shimmer, is there anything else?
Butterfly; butterfly what is the matter?
can't you give me an answer for the questions I desire?
Butterfly; butterfly I see you dying,
life is far too short to sit around crying.
Butterfly; butterfly don't you go,
for your goal has not yet been accomplished.
Butterfly; butterfly let me lift you,
I peer into your eyes and see that there's a secret inside.
Butterfly; butterfly let it out,
your secret could hold great things, give me the secret to life.
Butterfly; butterfly let me know,
before you take your last breath; show me what you hold.
Butterfly; butterfly there you go...
You twitch away letting me that the secret to life is having the courage...
to just let go.

Went down to the garden
and see a Caterppilar
Crawling struggling on the earth
In reality she is a butterfly
Working out for her rebirth,
and after her rebirth,
She's going to fly.
She is going to shed
that heavy coat and bounded
chain and take on her new wings.
and fly high above the sky.
If we are a worm
covered with the dust,
trying hard to please
but afraid to fail
and feel like
having nailed.
Remember we are a butterfly inside.
and he is going to shed the coat
and his nailed had set us free.
If we hang in there
You'll see, we are a butterfly
we are going to shed the coat
and someday reach,
Reach for the sky.

Butterfly, flutterby
Come to me
Take me to Mexico
On your delicate wing.
Butterfly, flutterby
It is early fall
I want to escape from here
To you I call.
Butterfly, flutterby
Be with me tonight
I’ll be ready in a minute
Ready for take-off; ready for flight.
Butterfly, flutterby
How gorgeous your face
Yellow, black, stained-glass wings
I see your mysterious smile and dainty grace.
Butterfly, flutterby
I’m waiting; I’ll stay
Please don’t forget me
But look! Now you’re going, going, gone, away.
Butterfly, flutterby
How can this be?
You said good bye
Now what about me?
Butterfly, flutterby
You could have come to me
Could have taken me to Mexico
On your delicate wing.
Butterfly, flutterby
This is not the end
Return for me next year
I will be waiting and watching, again and again.

If I were a butterfly
I would fly to your garden
Through smoky glasses
Watch with baleful inquisitive eyes
Till with an impatient sigh
You my fluttering presence spy....
If you would just open your window
I would my presence keep sweeping low
Find an inconspicuous corner
In your flower vase
imbibing with pleasure
memories to treasure
Your casual time of leisure...........
When you threw down  your car keys
and kicked off your shoes
All the tiredness let
Trickle off with water
Splashed with a gusto!
You relax
l too relax with  you..................
The poise and tranquility
that we as a pair
to this four walled confines bring
No man and woman can............
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~Malinikadir

Thine emulous fond flowers are dead, too,
And the daft sun-assaulter, he
That frighted thee so oft, is fled or dead:
Save only me
(Nor is it sad to thee!)
Save only me
There is none left to mourn thee in the fields.
The gray grass is not dappled with the snow;
Its two banks have not shut upon the river;
But it is long ago-
It seems forever-
Since first I saw thee glance,
With all the dazzling other ones,
In airy dalliance,
Precipitate in love,
Tossed, tangled, whirled and whirled above,
Like a limp rose-wreath in a fairy dance.
When that was, the soft mist
Of my regret hung not on all the land,
And I was glad for thee,
And glad for me, I wist.
Thou didst not know, who tottered, wandering on high,
That fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind,
With those great careless wings,
Nor yet did I.
And there were other things:
It seemed God let thee flutter from his gentle clasp:
Then fearful he had let thee win
Too far beyond him to be gathered in,
Snatched thee, o'er eager, with ungentle grasp.
Ah! I remember me
How once conspiracy was rife
Against my life-
The languor of it and the dreaming fond;
Surging, the grasses dizzied me of thought,
The breeze three odors brought,
And a gem-flower waved in a wand!
Then when I was distraught
And could not speak,
Sidelong, full on my cheek,
What should that reckless zephyr fling
But the wild touch of thy dye-dusty wing!
I found that wing broken to-day!
For thou are dead, I said,
And the strange birds say.
I found it with the withered leaves
Under the eaves.

The butterfly from flower to flower
The urchin chas’d; and, when at last
He caught it in my lady’s bower,
He cried, “Ha, ha!” and held it fast.
Awhile he laugh’d, but soon he wept,
When looking at the prize he’d caught
He found he had to ruin swept
The very glory he had sought

The stars
finding it hard
to keep their eyes
open.
Moon
tucked up
in a comfortable cloud
already fast
asleep
turns & smiles.
Even the dark
is nodding off
dreaming of
...light
Even the cricket
has gone
asleep
even the fire
sleeps
in a nightdress
of ashes
all this
dreamy night.
Only the baby
(our little sweetie)
lies awake
playing with
the bright butterfly
dancing in her
dress of brilliant colour
bobbing
on the string
before her.
She tells the butterfly
delightedly
over & over
that she is
beauty
but the butterfly
doesn’t understand
the language of gurgle.
Somewhere
in the dark
Da da
snores
Ma ma
sleeps quiet.

The railroad dick looked straight at him, eyes unwavering, beady-eyed, menacing, and Harry counted his change to see if there was enough for a bribe; searched his thoughts for an escape route, but he was not as young as he used to be and the dick was young, legs like a deer.
He tussled Barney’s hair and said:
“Go there in that thar car and wait for me, got to dump the dick. Wait for my whistle.”
Barney looked up him hesitantly and Harry stammered hoarsely
“Go! ”
Barney scrambled on all fours the way Harry had taught him and quickly disappeared under cover of the dark Chicago night.
Always, the dick against the Bos, the rich against the poor was Harry’s thought, been that way since her was born, the wanders, the lose, the lose people on the road trying to find an odd job and a meal, against the railroad fat cats trying to exterminate the railroad people, who what was just trying to get by.
Harry held his breath and told himself to concentrate and finally turned back to the dick and showed himself, full on so as the dick could get a good look at him. The dick wide-eyed and incredulous stared hard at Harry surprised by the brazenness of the tramp and stood stock still for a moment, prey in the eyes of the predator.
Harry swayed a little left and then a little right like a running back taunting the linebacker, which way boy, am I going to bolt, which way is the question. Harry feinted a dash to the right and the dick crouched right ready for the chase, Harry smiled and then feinted to the left, testing the dick’s reflexes. The dick danced to the left enjoying the thrilling moment before the chase.
Harry guessed Barney had had time to secure himself in the car and then dashed straight toward the dick, who was thoroughly surprised and steeled himself for what he thought would be a crash between the two men. But Harry at the last minute slanted right allowing the dick to remain close behind but not enough to lay hand on him.
He headed for track 13 for the Great Northern line car.
The dick was breathing behind him; Harry could hear his labored breaths, close enough but not close enough to grab, what was what Harry wanted.
He hit the Northern line yard and saw number 13 looming. The dick was laughing behind him yelping with the sheer joy of it all, feeling he had Harry cornered because the Northern lot was a closed in one, a big wall in the back, a closed station and of course cars, most closed.
But Harry was aiming toward 13 and left up into the car and waited for the dick to catch up and see him. Harry looked down at the man’s heaving chest smiling his best Harry smile.

From Deniliquin to Jerilderie paddocks gray and bare and brown
On to Narrandera and West Wyalong and many smaller country town,
To Forbes and Parkes and on through Dubbo, Gilgandra and Coonabarabran
Miles and miles of weary travel through the world of outback man.
On to Narribri and then to Moree on the north bound Newell highway
Through New South Wales the country's first State on a sunny April day
And we cross the Queensland border just after the sun go down
And we spend our first night in the Sunshine State in Goondiwindi Town.
Lettered signboards along the highway 'stop and rest for to survive'
From Victoria to South Queensland it's a long and tiring drive
For to see all of Australia it might take a century
It's a vast and open country and a lot of land to see.
Miles and miles of sunburnt country here and there a patch of green
Flocks of sheep and herds of cattle in the brownest land I've seen,
Kangaroos victims of traffic ravens pecking at their eyes
Here and there along the highway left as fodder for the flies.
This vast land of wondrous beauty is too big for man to tame
It's a wild and rugged country for want of a better name
Just a small part of Australia but the journey seems quite far
If you travel from Victoria to south Queensland in a car.
From the wooded hills of Sherbrooke to Echuca's border Town
On through New South Wales and northwards though a country wild and brown
On beyond South Queensland border to rest after tiring day
Just a small part of Australia but it seems a long, long way.

English professor and poet Narayana Kasturi
was an employee of All India Radio.
He had in an Indian humor magazine
made fun of Sathya Sai Baba. After
a series of miracles involving his
family, he became a devout follower
and editor of Baba's magazine
Sanathana Sarathi (eternal charioteer,
a reference to Krishna who would not
fight in the Mahabharata war but instead
was charioteer for Arjuna.)
One day a car caravan as often happened
was following Baba's car to a destination.
One after another, parts fell off of Kasturi's
car. When they arrived Kasturi took the car
to a mechanic who said it was physically
impossible for the car to have arrived.
Kasturi went to Baba and asked 'Was it
because we are good devotees that you
did this miracle for us? ' and Baba replied
'The car, the car is a great devotee.'

Decided are my ways;
Altered are my days,
for I know where to move;
For I know the way to reach.
My destination is too far to being seen.
With a map set in my mind,
With a slow speed I will start,
the engine of my car.
Well I am the lone driver,
I am the lone traveller;
Gear is set.
Mind is set right.
Mirror is well set up,
So that I get the three dimensional view.
Slowly I accelerated the speed,
Now I know the ABC of life,
I know when to apply break,
I know when to accelerate the speed
I know when to use clutch.
Here I am set to go!
I have to keep on moving,
On the same speed,
With my eyes and ears open,
My mind should work in coordination with,
My eyes, ears and hands.
My wonder car started,
Moving ahead all way.
It will wait for none,
Till my brain is in gear.
I will not turn back.
In between I will put a break
To give a pause to my brain too.
My wonder car started
Its moving towards a new way.
Through the path that seemed to be rough and smooth.
Today, Nothing matters me much.
I have to move ahead through unknown path.
With a steering controlled by my hand and mind.
I will move ahead with thrill and reach my destination.

Child, a moment of love ago
you danced in the eye of the woman
who made you. When another moment
like the innocent wheat that made the loaf
of bread she sent you for
in this field of the heart's ploughed land
you were threshed!

See my car,
I am driving the car
Ask not its name and number
I have already mentioned elsewhere here.
See my car,
I am driving the car,
Controlling the steering wheel
I am driving the car,
Giving due respect to
Accelerator and brake,
I know here in this car
There is the truth called engine,
Passion and action are there
In fuel and I know all knowledge
And everything is there in tool box
Provided by the company itself.
See my car
I am going with my car
To the service center
As it is not running well
As it met an accident
Though no fault of mine,
All of a sudden it met an accident
With the rain and the sun.

We're away! and the wind whistles shrewd
In our whiskers and teeth;
And the granite-like grey of the road
Seems to slide underneath.
As an eagle might sweep through the sky,
So we sweep through the land;
And the pallid pedestrians fly
When they hear us at hand.
We outpace, we outlast, we outstrip!
Not the fast-fleeing hare,
Nor the racehorses under the whip,
Nor the birds of the air
Can compete with our swiftness sublime,
Our ease and our grace.
We annihilate chickens and time
And policemen and space.
Do you mind that fat grocer who crossed?
How he dropped down to pray
In the road when he saw he was lost;
How he melted away
Underneath, and there rang through the fog
His earsplitting squeal
As he went -- Is that he or a dog,
That stuff on the wheel?

you sit inside the car
as i drive on this busy road
in the city, on some dangerous
intersections, and you hold your hair
with your left hand
leaning on the mirror
seeing the flow of people
on the pedestrian lane
and you quip,
why do you love a stupid
woman like me?
i focus myself on the road
and it begins to rain
and people are running
everywhere seeking
for shelter
you ask,
do you really love me?
i am sorry
putting you on this mess.
i am really sorry,
tears begin to roll
from your eyes
the rain goes heavily on
the glass and i cannot clearly
see the road
it is dark and i turn on the
front lights and drive
the car slowly on the side
of the road. I stop
for a while,
it is hazy, i said.
and i just love to kiss you.

Carpe diem makes my heart race
Carpe diem drives me to pursue
Carpe diem chases me on with reigns
This 'carpe diem' is driving me crazy
keeps me in a daze, that rat race
I must race.
Carpe diem reminds me
the light will soon be no more.

Life is so Precarious...
So Tenuous...
So Fleeting...
I would be happy right  now...
Just to open my eyes...
And SEIZE the Day...
(November 11,2010 Wausau, Wisconsin)

As the sun heads south
Go to the beach
Swim in the ocean
Build big sand castles
Cos summer and its shadow
Will soon be erased by time
Like words written
On sandy beaches
© 2016

Seize the Day
Use it well
Join the fray
Be compelled
Add some color
Make it glow
Give a holler
Let it show
Avoid the hearse
Don’t give up
Be the first
At sun up

Today is a day like no-other
Today is a very special day
So what ever you do
be it the dream you pursue
don't let it slip away
Never again will this day commence
And will be hence forth known in the past of tense.
Fide Literis

actually my dear, the most that matters is
now. This is the moment. There is no other.
what is inside my palm is not yours to guess
for i may not follow your wish
your dream, what is here inside me is alive
but only for this moment, there is no time to think
or imagine. This is only the moment. The now.
This is the only moment. It is now.
Hold my hand. As we pass the river of our lives.
Do not look back, as the rush of the water may be
too harsh. Look at my eyes. This is the only moment.
Do not look down at your feet. The water is flowing.
And flowing. There is nothing that you can hold
with your fingers and drink. It is and it will be impossible
to grasp, a past reality, a future possibility.
This is the only moment.This is the only truth. Grab it
with both hands and tell me. Now, is the only truth. This
moment of our lives. You hear the sound of a cascade.
That is what we are now.

Carpe Diem
Sunrise, Carpe Diem, seize the day
Life is like a play, so find your way
An infinite maze this reality seems to be
Locked up in your mind, warden you have the key
Fly high in the sky, free as a bird
Life is what you make it, have you heard
Open your ears open your eyes, blinded by the light
Know yourself and rise to a much greater height
Raise the bar, We are cheering you on
Someday both you and I will be gone
Maybe death is an illusion and we'll still be here
Hold your loved ones and friends ever so near
You never know when they'll have to go
Part of this awesome infinite show
So just play your role and play your role well good human
Create as you go, this is your divine plan
You're the artist do you understand
Forward thinking, what do you have planned
Just learn to enjoy yourself today, words of wisdom
Like basic math, add the numbers, what's the sum?
Counting numbers till the end of time
Keep counting till you hear the clock chime
Time a tool for reality, what is your goal?
In this life you must experience depth of soul.
Around we go, The lord of the ring
Flower of life, All of the birds sing
Like our great sun, circling our serene planet Earth
Watching the sunset will help you find your worth

The river will never catch you
if you understand white water.
Lightening will never strike you
if you heed to distant thunder.
Symbols can never haunt you
if your third-eye eschews them.
Death ne'er be yours to beckon
by year, day, hour, or second.
So go sail a raft, ignore the sky,
as cloud formations symbolize,
before your eyes...as you and I
have finally come to realize...
no matter where your logic lies
we were all born to live and die.

Λευκονόη,
μην το ψάχνεις και το ρωτάς.
Είν' αδύνατο να μάθεις
ποιο θά ' ναι για μένα, ποιο για σένα
το τέλος που μας εδώσαν οι θεοί.
Μήτε στα ζώδια της Βαβυλώνας οφελεί
να μπεις στον πειρασμό ν' αναζητήσεις.
Καρτέρα υπομονετικά καλλίτερα
ό, τ' είναι να συμβεί,
τους πολλούς χειμώνες
ή μονάχα αυτόν εδώ, αν τελευταίον
μας τον προόρισεν ο Δίας,
αυτόν π' αναταράζει μ΄ανεμοθύελες
το πέλαγο το τυρρηνικό.
Λογικέψου, ετοίμασε τα κρασάκια,
περιόρισε τις μακραίωνες ελπίδες.
Ακόμα και τούτην  ώρα  που τα λέμε
δραπετεύ' η κακόζηλη ζωή.
[Σα λουλούδι λοιπόν]
δρέψε την κάθε σου μέρα.
΄Οσο λιγότερο έλπιζε στην υστεραία.

To everything there is a season,
A time of gladness, grief and cheer,
Smiles of laughter, sadness of tears,
For every sunset there's a sunrise,
There is no rainbow without the rain,
No summer time without the spring,
Golden days and frosty nights,
Icy winds thoughout the days,
With winters newly fallen snows,
Whose years are like the seasons,
Let the future hold no doubt,
There'll come a change of scene,
With rain bound skies of hope and love,
I have seen your different faces,
Life is like the changing seasons,
Upward always climb,
As the seasons change as we.

Oh, how I love it
When I have a change of address
And I have to tell everybody
That I have just moved
And you have to leave
The friends that you have
But, you do find new ones
At your new address

It seems right now no one has the time
When I’m about to lose my mind
My sadness makes me write
But sometimes I want to fight
Everything has to change
But it all seems so strange
When I talk
All you do is mock

Change the N-word now
Change it forever
Make the world better

I cannot change, as others do,
Though you unjustly scorn;
Since that poor swain that sighs for you,
For you alone was born.
No, Phyllis, no, your heart to move
A surer way I'll try:
And to revenge my slighted love,
Will still love on, will still love on, and die.
When, killed with grief, Amintas lies
And you to mind shall call,
The sighs that now unpitied rise,
The tears that vainly fall,
That welcome hour that ends this smart
Will then begin your pain;
For such a fauthful tender heart
Can never break, can never break in vain.

But where began the change; and what's my crime?
The wretch condemned, who has not been arraigned,
Chafes at his sentence. Shall I, unsustained,
Drag on Love's nerveless body thro' all time?
I must have slept, since now I wake. Prepare,
You lovers, to know Love a thing of moods:
Not like hard life, of laws. In Love's deep woods,
I dreamt of loyal Life:--the offence is there!
Love's jealous woods about the sun are curled;
At least, the sun far brighter there did beam.
My crime is, that the puppet of a dream,
I plotted to be worthy of the world.
Oh, had I with my darling helped to mince
The facts of life, you still had seen me go
With hindward feather and with forward toe,
Her much-adored delightful Fairy Prince!

How long can stay the happiness?
How long can stay the sadness?
Nothing in this world can go always up
Nothing in this world can go only down.
Nothing in this world remains the same forever.
As the day changes to night,
And the night changes to day.
As the cold changes to warm,
and warm changes to cold.
As this natural law always changes everything,
up to down and down to up.
So long as there is nothing without an opposite, smile...
The Death will change to Birth!

I thank you profusely,
From the depths of my heart,
For promoting me, at last,
To Professor cadre.
If it had been earlier,
It would have been better;
It could have been better,
But it doesn’t matter.
Yet, was it in my fate?
I’as unique till date;
Was it because of others?
Whom I thought were brothers!
What’s past is past;
When things looked aghast;
But we know truth will last;
Though the world is fast.
But I am very glad,
That I’m no longer sad;
My image that seemed bad,
Is better now on pad.
Not a visit, I’ad made;
I call a spade a spade;
And I’as ne’er afraid,
Nor did I look for aid.
And all I know is this,
‘A man aright has bliss’
Though cruel be world’s kiss;
And things do go amiss.
When God is by my side;
And I in Him abide;
And truth is my great pride;
The stormy waves, I ride!
But why such things happen?
And why men jump the fen?
All fruits one day ripen;
All wells, one must deepen.
Why men choose easy routes?
Can one wear always boots?
We eat our parent’s fruits;
And go about in suits!
But shouldn’t we change for good?
Too much is poison-food;
And why to fret and brood?
And why to wear a hood?
Our stay on earth is short;
And life can well abort;
Lets change our minds and heart;
And practice genuine art.
All men are just brothers;
Lets think about others;
Some beasts do need feathers;
A thing with time weathers.
Don’t believe what some say;
Each man will have his day;
We go in God’s way;
Or for our blunders pay!
Lets make this world of men,
And things uneven, even;
Lets make the earth, Heaven;
In time that’s God-given!

Your love
was worth millions
but as the Royal Mint
admitted
it is like the lost loose change
of Britain
(apparently there's
£26 million of it)
just lying about
... out there
... somewhere.
So far, I have picked up
£6 and nine pence worth of you.

You can hear the excitement start to linger as the early morning train departs.
Finally at the station everyone rushes toward the exit like Kaner on a breakaway to the goal.
We all walked to Grant Park like little kids running after an ice cream truck.
You are a part of the sea of red walking through the gates surrounded by police.
Finally, we made it. We are inside the park.
We ran through huge crowds pushing and shoving trying to get to the corner of the street like Andrew Shaw searching for the puck in front of the net.
We all waited anxiously to see our favorite players.
There it is, it’s the Stanley Cup. I can see it shining like the pregame ice on “The Madhouse on Madison”.
You try to take pictures as people scream and jump to get a closer look.
It’s “The” Jonathan Toews, captain of The Chicago Blackhawks, raising ‘The Cup’ to kiss it.
You can see the pride of the 3 million fans as confetti is shot when the players drive by celebrating.
It’s over and you try to get out of the park like Marian Hossa skating out of the penalty box.
You’re stuck in the train station not able to move, surrounded by smelly loud fans for two hours.
Finally the doors open and people push and shove like they are in a hockey fight.
You run onto the train weaving through people to try and save a seat for your friends just as Patrick sharp weaves through players to score goals.
As you leave the station you see everyone slip down into their seats like they just got hit in the face with a puck.

My body has changed forever,
The needle piercing my skin,
Making forth an image, the art so clever,
Ink marking my heritage, and my kin.
The needle piercing my skin,
It forms a four-leaved shamrock,
Ink marking my heritage, and my kin,
Watching the clock slowly clicking, tick-tock, tick-tock.
It forms a four-leaved shamrock,
Now forming an orange, white, and green flag,
Watching the clock slowly clicking, tick-tock, tick-tock,
Marking my body, as if it were an Irish tag.
Now forming an orange, white, and green flag,
My body,17 years old, but feeling a new,
Marking my body, as if it were an Irish tag,
For now I’m a walking art, with this new tattoo.

Chicago why do you have to change?
chicago acting so plan
chicago your better than what the people
say your the first thing that comes to mind
chicago is a place being with all kinds
of faces learning about new cases to in
brace the mistakes that people make like acting
fake why chicago?

The Lincoln Park Zoo reaches out
'Round the Chicago neighborhood,
To share of nature all about,
How human connect can be good,
Ever growing in time and place,
Spreading the truth of nature's worth,
Made better by the human race,
'Round the neighborhood, 'round the Earth.
Within the beauty of Zoo grounds,
Or in endeavors far and wide,
Bettering nature knows no bounds,
Lincoln Park Zoo is filled with pride.
Lincoln Park Zoo phenomenon,
The Pride of Chicago thrives on.

The Yards was what the world called me.
Where Chicago did meet the meat,
Packed in over a century,
Butchered for all the world to eat.
The Chicago River did pump
Half a million gallons per day.
Loads of beast decay I did dump.
I did smell bad from long away.
Sinclair's 'The Jungle' gave me shame.
Sinatra's 'My Kind of Town' sang.
Sandburg's 'Chicago' gave me fame.
Tourists came to me, just to hang.
I was torn down in progress fate.
All that remains is my main gate.

Of forthcoming weather no prophet have they,
For the ground hog is there to be seen every day.

'My age, my beast!' - Osip Mandelstam
On the lips a taste of tolling we are blind
The light drifts like dust over faces
We wear masks on our genitals
You've heard of lighting cigarettes with banknotes we used to light ours with Jews
History is made of bricks you can't go through it
And bricks are made of bones and blood and
Bones and blood are made of little tiny circles that nothing can go through Except a piano with rabies
Blood gushes into, not from, our wounds
Vietnamese Cuban African bloods
Constellations of sperm upon our bodies
Drunk as dogs before our sons
The bearded foetus lines up at the evolution-trough
Swarmy bloods in the rabid piano
The air over Chicago is death's monogram
This is the Were-Age rushing past
Speed: 10,000 men per minute
This is the species bred of death
The manshriek of flesh
The lifeless sparks of flesh
Covering the deep drums of vision
O new era race-wars jugular-lightning
Dark glance bursting from the over-ripe future
Know we are not the smilelines of dreams
Nor the pores of the Invisible
Piano with rabies we are victorious over
The drum and the wind-chime
We bite back a voice that might have emerged
To tame these dead bodies aid wet ashes

she wears
two platinum bracelets
on her
wrists
dressed in golden
yellow
her reading glasses
on
she poses as he takes her
picture
against the yellow leaves
falling
the wind passes
another year is marked
in the autumn of
their years

Waiting patiently a quarter to one,
we heard the whistle blow.
I looked at the others, took deep breaths,
it’s almost time to go.
The train approached, there it was
bigger than life in front of me.
my first time to jump the coal train
and take that coal for free.
We ran with strength and agility,
sprung like jumping jacks.
Took our places a top the car,
zooming along the railroad tracks.
Quickly with all the strength we had,
we threw coal to the ground.
The next task was to bag it up
and sell it in our town.
The coal train came everyday
at a quarter to one,
my first day would be my last,
I put my coal bag down.
Another true story of my childhood in Sydney Nova
Scotia.  Jumping the old coal train to make a few cents,
very little gain indeed.  Looking back once again, I see
the danger of the act, for what was profited certainly
wasn’t worth all that.  A word to the young, “stay out
of harms way, remain honest and true,  the coal train
was not for me and certainly not for you.

If I don't
go and
go
when I need to
go
I still
go
anyway
without
going there

When I was very little
I use to dream that I could fly.
I'd put some rubber bans around my shoes
leaped up and I was flying in the sky!
Flying over hill and dale
looking down on those I knew.
They would look up at me in wonder
all wondering how I flew.
I'm older now and don't seem to dream that way
was that only for that time?
How complex the human brain can be
all those thoughts trapped in our minds.
I dream today, that is for certain
but some I can't recall.
And then there are days, they all go away
before I awake I've lost them all.
Where do these dreams originate?
Are they coming from another place and time?
Or are they just the brains way of escaping
the daily stresses of my mind?
For now I'll just have to sleep and dream
dream what my mind has in store.
But I hope one day, Childhood dreams of flight
of jumping high in the sky to sore!

Back when I was a kid at play,
we played  games throughout the day,
Telephone wires that snapped on the ground,
were our skipping ropes we had found.
Stilts were made from wood poles so grand,
Walked my brother from a roof tops  across the land.
Back yard swamps were cleared during autumn rush,
Which made winter skating go from Dawn to Dusk.
An important  roll my big brother did play,
Tying a rope around me,  on hot swimming days,
Someone would ask,  'What good will that do.'
-'Just pull me up,  if I  should turn blue.'
Needing some money,  we walked the ditch,
looking for pop bottles to make our pitch.
Our crew hiked to town,  It was our only way,
To see a good movie on a free Saturday.
Now the woods was a place of wonder
Rocking ourselves from one pine tree  to another.
Forts were built,  and hide and seek  played.
From the house,  the cars horn blew by end of day.
Oh how  I miss the days as a kid
When your imagination ran wild through your head
Friendships held strong,  throughout the years
The trust has remained,  as we laugh with tears.

She does not know that rooms are bleak and bare,
That poverty dwells with us all the while;
It is enough for her that I am there
To praise her little deeds, to sing and smile.
She does not know that heartache hovers near
Above the place where lie her dolls asleep,
That eyes grow wide and dark with naked fear
And life seems such a tired trust to keep.
Sunlight to her is earth's most precious gold,
Daisies and buttercups are jewels rare,
A clump of mignonette is wealth untold,
Her crown a wreath of flowers in her hair.
No banquet hall in all the bounteous land
Has half the glory of a picnic spread
Out on a shining beach, with sun and sand,
Wind in her face, and seagulls overhead.
Oh, may our hearts be glad for common things,
Whitecaps at sea and tattered driftwood piled,
Finding in these the peace that Heaven brings.
Grant us the simple wisdom of a child.

I miss my old home
It had a broken mirror
I couldn't see my face
I miss my childhood
It had a broken memory
It was a lonely place
But it felt comforting
We have one childhood
Whether it's good or bad
We remember those days
and all the fun we had
But it could also be ugly
The way it was for me
I was picked on alot
They made fun of me
Now I'm getting older
But, I'm still a child
This world gets colder
For each and every child.

Up on the hill
In the posh areas
Where the Victorian villas
Were set back from tree lined roads,
The gas lamps in the streets were
Wrought iron, carved and elegant.
The lampleerie would open them
And light each lamp
One by one.
As each glowed with a warm soft light
They seemed like necklaces;
Shining jewels beading
Their way around the night.
Down near the docks
The tenements were dark and dank.
Their closes shadowed
With children's ghostly fears.
But every night at twilight
Our leerie came down from the hill.
With his long pole
He stretched up, turned on the taps.
Spluttering flames first blue
Then coming to brilliant life,
Spreading wide arcs of welcoming light.
And all our  bogeymen took flight.

Childhood Is
when the world to come
is an adventure to be met
Childhood Is
running and hiding
peeking around blind corners
hoping you have been followed
Childhood Is
ducking and diving
dreaming of being in the best
football team in the world
and scoring the winning goal
in the Cup FInal
Childhood Is
being the perfect person
(or not being caught out
when you're not being
the perfect person)
Childhood Is
a mass of contradictions
you don't want to unravel
Childhood Is
a nice cosy bed,
clean sheets
and Mummy's kisses

We shall not ever meet them bearded in heaven
Nor sunning themselves among the bald of hell;
If anywhere, in the deserted schoolyard at twilight,
forming a ring, perhaps, or joining hands
In games whose very names we have forgotten.
Come memory, let us seek them there in the shadows.

Today I found a can of paint.
The paintbrush was there, too.
Mommy must have left it
when her painting was all through.
It was such a pretty color,
I learned you call it 'red'.
It made me think of pretty things
that same color in my head.
I painted rainbows from the sky,
and hearts, and bows for hair.
When Mommy saw it, she got mad
and sat me in a chair.
She told me I was naughty
and to think of what I’d done.
While I thought, she scrubbed and scrubbed
and cleaned off all my fun.
I’ll never understand my mom,
why she laughed when we were through...
I only said I wished
the pretty color had been blue.

So, this is Christmas morning...
everyone is here.
I don't really understand it
cause it isn't very clear,
but Mom and Dad are happy,
there's pretty ribbons everywhere,
lots of things that they call presents
and even paper I can tear.
They keep showing me this new stuff,
balls and books and even soxes...
they don't seem to know how fun it is
just playing with these boxes.

Come to me, O ye children!
For I hear you at your play,
And the questions that perplexed me
Have vanished quite away.
Ye open the eastern windows,
That look towards the sun,
Where thoughts are singing swallows
And the brooks of morning run.
In your hearts are the birds and the sunshine,
In your thoughts the brooklet's flow,
But in mine is the wind of Autumn
And the first fall of the snow.
Ah! what would the world be to us
If the children were no more?
We should dread the desert behind us
Worse than the dark before.
What the leaves are to the forest,
With light and air for food,
Ere their sweet and tender juices
Have been hardened into wood, --
That to the world are children;
Through them it feels the glow
Of a brighter and sunnier climate
Than reaches the trunks below.
Come to me, O ye children!
And whisper in my ear
What the birds and the winds are singing
In your sunny atmosphere.
For what are all our contrivings,
And the wisdom of our books,
When compared with your caresses,
And the gladness of your looks?
Ye are better than all the ballads
That ever were sung or said;
For ye are living poems,
And all the rest are dead.

Little shadows, little shadows
Dancing on the chamber wall,
While I sit beside the hearthstone
Where the red flames rise and fall.
Caps and nightgowns, caps and nightgowns,
My three antic shadows wear;
And no sound they make in playing,
For the six small feet are bare.
Dancing gayly, dancing gayly,
To and fro all together,
Like a family of daisies
Blown about in windy weather;
Nimble fairies, nimble fairies,
Playing pranks in the warm glow,
While I sing the nursery ditties
Childish phantoms love and know.
Now what happens, now what happens?
One small shadow's tumbled down:
I can see it on the carpet
Softly rubbing its hurt crown.
No one whimpers, no one whimpers;
A brave-hearted sprite is this:
See! the others offer comfort
In a silent, shadowy kiss.
Hush! they're creeping; hush! they're creeping,
Up about my rocking-chair:
I can feel their loving fingers
Clasp my neck and touch my hair.
Little shadows, little shadows,
Take me captive, hold me tight,
As they climb and cling and whisper,
"Mother dear, good night! good night!"

I had eight birds hatched in one nest,
Four cocks there were, and hens the rest.
I nursed them up with pain and care,
Nor cost, nor labour did I spare,
Till at the last they felt their wing,
Mounted the trees, and learned to sing;
Chief of the brood then took his flight
To regions far and left me quite.
My mournful chirps I after send,
Till he return, or I do end:
Leave not thy nest, thy dam and sire,
Fly back and sing amidst this choir.
My second bird did take her flight,
And with her mate flew out of sight;
Southward they both their course did bend,
And seasons twain they there did spend,
Till after blown by southern gales,
They norward steered with filled sails.
A prettier bird was no where seen,
Along the beach among the treen.
I have a third of colour white,
On whom I placed no small delight;
Coupled with mate loving and true,
Hath also bid her dam adieu;
And where Aurora first appears,
She now hath perched to spend her years.
One to the academy flew
To chat among that learned crew;
Ambition moves still in his breast
That he might chant above the rest
Striving for more than to do well,
That nightingales he might excel.
My fifth, whose down is yet scarce gone,
Is 'mongst the shrubs and bushes flown,
And as his wings increase in strength,
On higher boughs he'll perch at length.
My other three still with me nest,
Until they're grown, then as the rest,
Or here or there they'll take their flight,
As is ordained, so shall they light.
If birds could weep, then would my tears
Let others know what are my fears
Lest this my brood some harm should catch,
And be surprised for want of watch,
Whilst pecking corn and void of care,
They fall un'wares in fowler's snare,
Or whilst on trees they sit and sing,
Some untoward boy at them do fling,
Or whilst allured with bell and glass,
The net be spread, and caught, alas.
Or lest by lime-twigs they be foiled,
Or by some greedy hawks be spoiled.
O would my young, ye saw my breast,
And knew what thoughts there sadly rest,
Great was my pain when I you fed,
Long did I keep you soft and warm,
And with my wings kept off all harm,
My cares are more and fears than ever,
My throbs such now as 'fore were never.
Alas, my birds, you wisdom want,
Of perils you are ignorant;
Oft times in grass, on trees, in flight,
Sore accidents on you may light.
O to your safety have an eye,
So happy may you live and die.
Meanwhile my days in tunes I'll spend,
Till my weak lays with me shall end.
In shady woods I'll sit and sing,
And things that past to mind I'll bring.
Once young and pleasant, as are you,
But former toys (no joys) adieu.
My age I will not once lament,
But sing, my time so near is spent.
And from the top bough take my flight
Into a country beyond sight,
Where old ones instantly grow young,
And there with seraphims set song;
No seasons cold, nor storms they see;
But spring lasts to eternity.
When each of you shall in your nest
Among your young ones take your rest,
In chirping language, oft them tell,
You had a dam that loved you well,
That did what could be done for young,
And nursed you up till you were strong,
And 'fore she once would let you fly,
She showed you joy and misery;
Taught what was good, and what was ill,
What would save life, and what would kill.
Thus gone, amongst you I may live,
And dead, yet speak, and counsel give:
Farewell, my birds, farewell adieu,
I happy am, if well with you.

Monkey see,
monkey do,
I used to want
to be one, too.
He doesn't have a bedtime.
Bet he doesn't eat green beans!
Monkeys get to play around
the whole day long, it seems.
He doesn't have to brush his teeth
or have to comb his hair.
If he had toys I'll bet his dad
wouldn't make him have to share.
Bet he doesn't 'scuse me'
after each and every sneeze.
And you won't hear him 'thank you'
after every single 'please'.
But Mommy said that monkeys
don't ever watch TV...
that's when I decided
I'd rather just stay me.

I love to be a cowboy
and ride my horse around the room.
He's black and white and he won't bite
(he's really Mommy's broom) .
I shoot my guns at bad guys
when I ride down the trail.
(they're really just my dog and cat
and my closet is the jail) .
I ride and rope wild horses, too,
and bring them to my camp
(it's really just the 'lectric cord)
...uh oh, I broke a lamp!
Oops!  Here comes the Sheriff
and it looks like he is mad!
I'd better clean this mess up!
('cause the Sheriff's really Dad) .

Thank God for little children,
Bright flowers by earth's wayside,
The dancing, joyous lifeboats
Upon life's stormy tide.
Thank God for little children;
When our skies are cold and gray,
They come as sunshine to our hearts,
And charm our cares away.
I almost think the angels,
Who tend life's garden fair,
Drop down the sweet wild blossoms
That bloom around us here.
It seems a breath of heaven
Round many a cradle lies,
And every little baby
Brings a message from the skies.
Dear mothers, guard these jewels.
As sacred offerings meet,
A wealth of household treasures
To lay at Jesus' feet.

Snow was flaking all around
then gently piling on the ground.
Just tiny puffs when floating free,
but stuck together, I could see
it's like one voice that singing for us
or a lot, like in a chorus.
I rolled some up and stacked it high
to make a happy snowman guy.
I'm glad it's that way just with snow
and that's not how we children grow,
'cause on a warm and sunny day,
my snowman slowly melts away.
As he melts, he gets so thin.
I wish, like me, that he had skin.

I like words like 'yes' and 'no'
they mean just what they say.
They either mean you can or can't
do what you want today.
Other words like 'maybe'
or even like 'we'll see'
make me feel like crying
'cause that isn't answering me.
'Someday' isn't too bad
'cause it still means we will...
but 'later' is even better
'cause it's waiting just until.

Early on Christmas Day,
Love, as awake I lay,
And heard the Christmas bells ring sweet and clearly,
My heart stole through the gloom
Into your silent room,
And whispered to your heart, `I love you dearly.'
There, in the dark profound,
Your heart was sleeping sound,
And dreaming some fair dream of summer weather.
At my heart's word it woke,
And, ere the morning broke,
They sang a Christmas carol both together.
Glory to God on high!
Stars of the morning sky,
Sing as ye sang upon the first creation,
When all the Sons of God
Shouted for joy abroad,
And earth was laid upon a sure foundation.
Glory to God again!
Peace and goodwill to men,
And kindly feeling all the wide world over,
Where friends with joy and mirth
Meet round the Christmas hearth,
Or dreams of home the solitary rover.
Glory to God! True hearts,
Lo, now the dark departs,
And morning on the snow-clad hills grows grey.
Oh, may love's dawning light
Kindled from loveless night,
Shine more and more unto the perfect day!

'Twas the night before christmas.
With a blanket of white.
That covered the earth all through the night.
The trees sparkled like diamonds.
With a glitter so bright.
That each little twinkle made its own christmas light.
A hope and a prayer a white christmas would be.
Awaiting the dawn so all could see.
The beauty and joy a white christmas does bring.
To the holiday season as carolers sing.
For twas the night before Christmas.
God answered your prayer.
With a blanket of white.
Placed with God's loving care."

The kings they came from out the south,
All dressed in ermine fine;
They bore Him gold and chrysoprase,
And gifts of precious wine.
The shepherds came from out the north,
Their coats were brown and old;
They brought Him little new-born lambs--
They had not any gold.
The wise men came from out the east,
And they were wrapped in white;
The star that led them all the way
Did glorify the night.
The angels came from heaven high,
And they were clad with wings;
And lo, they brought a joyful song
The host of heaven sings.
The kings they knocked upon the door,
The wise men entered in,
The shepherds followed after them
To hear the song begin.
The angels sang through all the night
Until the rising sun,
But little Jesus fell asleep
Before the song was done.

Coloured lights and tinsel.
Hang from almost every branch.
Card with little jingles.
Also make their stance.
An angel stands on the top.
Looks down with peace and good will.
The tree is almost ready now.
To stand by the window sill.

Put up a splash of Christmas spirit
Put in a dash of love
Stir up the sounds ‘till you can hear it
Sing out to those you love
Christmas, Christmas, you can fill me
Up with Christmas cheer
Christmas, Christmas, you fulfill my
Spirit every year
Toss up a mash of extra magic
Toss in a batch of love
Let up the lights with random logic
Look out for sleighs above
Santa, Santa, can I have it
Please I’ve been so good
Santa, Santa, please I beg you
Please oh if you would
Get up a clash of Christmas color
Get in a catch of love
Set up and show the shiny decor
Shout out with Christmas love
Listen, listen, you can see it
Spirit everywhere
Listen, listen, you can do it
Spread it out and share
Put up a splash of Christmas spirit
Put in a dash of love
Stir up the sounds ‘till you can hear it
Sing out to those you love
Christmas, Christmas, you can fill me
Up with Christmas cheer
Christmas, Christmas, you fulfill my
Spirit every year

After dark
Near the South Dakota border,
The moon is out hunting, everywhere,
Delivering fire,
And walking down hallways
Of a diamond.
Behind a tree,
It ights on the ruins
Of a white city
Frost, frost.
Where are they gone
Who lived there?
Bundled away under wings
And dark faces.
I am sick
Of it, and I go on
Living, alone, alone,
Past the charred silos, past the hidden graves
Of Chippewas and Norwegians.
This cold winter
Moon spills the inhuman fire
Of jewels
Into my hands.
Dead riches, dead hands, the moon
Darkens,
And I am lost in the beautiful white ruins
Of America.

Our Christmas tree, stood straight and tall,
We had it standing in the hall,
With decorations, sparkling bright,
And baubles, glittering in the light,
Rich tinsel laced around branches wide,
With bells and bows, that could be spied
Hiding among the dark green pine,
In silver and gold, boldly they did shine,
And at the very top, such a wondrous sight,
A star was placed there, which gave delight.
The whole effect so pleasured the eye.
We planted it outside, now it's 18 feet high.
This year it will once again, be a thrill,
Hung with big coloured lights, in the crisp winter chill.

Wrapped was the world in slumber deep,
By seaward valley and cedarn steep,
And bright and blest were the dreams of its sleep;
All the hours of that wonderful night-tide through
The stars outblossomed in fields of blue,
A heavenly chaplet, to diadem
The King in the manger of Bethlehem.
Out on the hills the shepherds lay,
Wakeful, that never a lamb might stray,
Humble and clean of heart were they;
Thus it was given them to hear
Marvellous harpings strange and clear,
Thus it was given them to see
The heralds of the nativity.
In the dim-lit stable the mother mild
Looked with holy eyes on her child,
Cradled him close to her heart and smiled;
Kingly purple nor crown had he,
Never a trapping of royalty;
But Mary saw that the baby's head
With a slender nimbus was garlanded.
Speechless her joy as she watched him there,
Forgetful of pain and grief and care,
And every thought in her soul was a prayer;
While under the dome of the desert sky
The Kings of the East from afar drew nigh,
And the great white star that was guide to them
Kept ward o'er the manger of Bethlehem.

Once again it's Christmas Time,
time for us to be,
Busy wrapping presents
and setting up the tree.
It seems we have so many things,
to think of and to do,
We may forget that Christmas,
has a deeper meaning too.
A meaning that goes far beyond,
the things the eye can see,
Such as Holly wreaths, Mistletoe,
and Gifts beneath the tree.
For these are only Symbols,
of what happened Christmas morn,
When in a little manger,
GOD's only Son was born.
GOD put HIM here upon this Earth,
with one idea in mind.
To put New Hope around the World,
and LOVE in all Mankind.
So even though we're busy,
and have many things to do,
Let's not forget that Christmas,
has a deeper Meaning too.

Cinderella a woman of thoughts
A woman of brave and questioning mind
Stood for education and empowerment
Never brawled but a bravura in actions.
Cinderella had grown to woman hood
Facing all challenges to the girls
Still faced them in her style of brave
No one had courage to face her challenges.
She was not a bravado someone suspected
She was a hero in circumstances warranted
A valiant girl fought for justice
Never she minded the cowards opposing progress.

When the countdown's over
I won't be disappeared
I still want to meet you
If I could
If it's still the same
If the time stops
I don't need pumpkin cart
I don't need glittering gown
And I don't need glass shoes
Till midnight
Stop the needle of clock
from cyber idol mink

On the white sheet you lie stretched out,
your hot breath is caressing my cheek softly,
with the yellow-peach rain you did come
when the thunder hangs grey-white curtains.
The deep smell of your perfume overwhelms me,
lingers in clothes as it sometimes do,
we become part of each other, time passes,
when dreams and reality meet
and on the morning I find your lost shoe.

A light like yours can lead me home.
A body warm inside my arms.
A fantasy so alive, made of flesh and bone.
A voice of warmth, a scent of light.
The taste of sunshine and the sound of your sight.
Might just be enough to save my mind.
If only once again I can find.
Cinderella dressed in white.
Standing next to me tonight

It’s Midnight my love
Its time for me to disappear
And leave behind my
Golden slipper
For you to find
Making sure that
There will be another
Evening of pure delight
Don’t stop me my love
It’s a written rule from above
That your Cinderella
Must leave no matter what
At midnight on the dot
For if she does not
Yours will not
Be a happy lot
Please turn around my love
Cast a glance at the
Beauty that abounds
In this lovely gathering
Of dolled up ladies waiting
To play the game of mating
While you do that
Like lightening
I will be gone
For now
but I promise
I will come back again

Cinderella the cute girl
Cinderella the poor girl
The kind full heart there have
The noble thoughts always
Still there were enemies
The poor Cinderella wandered
Chased by the devils
Grace of god protected
Demons made there traps
God saved from dangers
Poor Cinderella have no death
Wandering for well being
Of the living Cinderellas
In countries beyond her reach
Warning to safety ways she cares
Cinderella a symbol of love
Cinderella a sign of hardship
Cinderella a victim always
Still triumphed on her love
Faced the life challenges
And got married to the prince.

I'm a modern Cinderella.
I wish I was more like Twighlight's Bella.
But i'm locked away.
It's like that everyday.
I'm the modern Cinderella.
I wish I was the Enchanted Ella.
My family wants to get rid of me.
This no one really sees.
I'm the Modern Cinderella.
Never mind Bella.
I'm meeting you for the very first time.
This the day I challenge my self to sing 'The Climb.'
I'm the modern Cinderella
Never mind Ella.
We feel in love at first sight.
Now the clock strikes midnight.
I'm the modern Cinderella.
Never the orginal.
Never mind Bella.
Never mind Ella.
I don't run in flight.
I'm prepared to fight.
I'm the modern Cinderella.
See me as I am.
See the real me.
Not the person I pretened to be.
I'm the modern Cinderella.
Nothing like the original.
Not like Bella.
Not like Ella.
Now i've found my modern Prince.
I am me.
I'm the Modern Cinderella....

Fancy clothes, tiara like a queen
Why can't I come in my jeans?
Manicured nails, skin like a dove
Why can't I wear my baseball glove?
Jewellery from head to toe
Even though I don't wanna go
Don't need my hair curled or any more make-up
So much 'girlishness' I think I might just throw up
Do I really have to go to the ball
And no lets NOT head to the mall
'Cause all this princess stuff is making me wince
And I certainly not marrying any prince
'Cause all I wanna do is watch wrestling on TV
So stop trying to make a Cinderella out of me! ! !

Already I am no longer looked at with lechery or love.
My daughters and sons have put me away with marbles and dolls,
Are gone from the house.
My husband and lovers are pleasant or somewhat polite
And night is night.
It is a real chill out,
The genuine thing.
I am not deceived, I do not think it is still summer
Because sun stays and birds continue to sing.
It is summer-gone that I see, it is summer-gone.
The sweet flowers indrying and dying down,
The grasses forgetting their blaze and consenting to brown.
It is a real chill out. The fall crisp comes
I am aware there is winter to heed.
There is no warm house
That is fitted with my need.
I am cold in this cold house this house
Whose washed echoes are tremulous down lost halls.
I am a woman, and dusty, standing among new affairs.
I am a woman who hurries through her prayers.
Tin intimations of a quiet core to be my
Desert and my dear relief
Come: there shall be such islanding from grief,
And small communion with the master shore.
Twang they. And I incline this ear to tin,
Consult a dual dilemma. Whether to dry
In humming pallor or to leap and die.
Somebody muffed it?? Somebody wanted to joke.

Imprisoned in squalor, like a rat in a cage
A hopeless ignition explodes into rage
Poverty's chains cut with mocking intent
Desensitized humans with anger to vent
To offer a dream, but a nightmare provide
To build up hope then strip away pride
To trample the weak into the dust
Is to set a foundation for greed and lust
The rat is a fighter, the worm always turns
Where once there was apathy, pride now returns
The lesser will rise with fear as their friend
From the sewer of life you can only ascend
To offer no dream, and nowhere to run
To Build up hope in the form of a gun
To trample the good and the decent within
Is to set up a struggle that no one can win
Man is a lover and killer entwined
To be an extreme is to conquer the blind
Where one man falls another now stands
Ready for death with blood on his hands

I
As the blind Milton's memory of light,
The deaf Beethoven's phantasy of tone,
Wroght joys for them surpassing all things known
In our restricted sphere of sound and sight,--
So while the glaring streets of brick and stone
Vix with heat, noise, and dust from morn till night,
I will give rein to Fancy, taking flight
From dismal now and here, and dwell alone
With new-enfranchised senses. All day long,
Think ye 't is I, who sit 'twixt darkened walls,
While ye chase beauty over land and sea?
Uplift on wings of some rare poet's song
Where the wide billow laughs and leaps and falls,
I soar cloud-high, free as the winds are free.
II
Who grasps the substance? who 'mid shadows strays?
He who within some dark-bright wood reclines,
'Twixt sleep and waking, where the needled pines
Have cushioned al his couch with soft brown sprays?
He notes not how the living water shines,
Trembling along the cliff, a flickering haze,
Brimming a wine-bright pool, nor lifts his gaze
To read the ancient wonders and the signs.
Does he possess the actual, or do I,
Who paint on air more than his sense receives,
The glittering pine-tufts with closed eyes behold,
Breathe the strong resinous perfume, see the sky
Quiver like azure flame between the leaves,
And open unseen gates with key of gold?

LONDON, thou art of townes A per se.
Soveraign of cities, seemliest in sight,
Of high renoun, riches and royaltie;
Of lordis, barons, and many a goodly knyght;
Of most delectable lusty ladies bright;
Of famous prelatis, in habitis clericall;
Of merchauntis full of substaunce and of myght:
London, thou art the flour of Cities all.
Gladdith anon, thou lusty Troynovaunt,
Citie that some tyme cleped was New Troy;
In all the erth, imperiall as thou stant,
Pryncesse of townes, of pleasure and of joy,
A richer restith under no Christen roy;
For manly power, with craftis naturall,
Fourmeth none fairer sith the flode of Noy:
London, thou art the flour of Cities all.
Gemme of all joy, jasper of jocunditie,
Most myghty carbuncle of vertue and valour;
Strong Troy in vigour and in strenuytie;
Of royall cities rose and geraflour;
Empress of townes, exalt in honour;
In beawtie beryng the crone imperiall;
Swete paradise precelling in pleasure;
London, thou art the flour of Cities all.
Above all ryvers thy Ryver hath renowne,
Whose beryall stremys, pleasaunt and preclare,
Under thy lusty wallys renneth down,
Where many a swan doth swymme with wyngis fair;
Where many a barge doth saile and row with are;
Where many a ship doth rest with top-royall.
O, towne of townes! patrone and not compare,
London, thou art the flour of Cities all.
Upon thy lusty Brigge of pylers white
Been merchauntis full royall to behold;
Upon thy stretis goeth many a semely knyght
In velvet gownes and in cheynes of gold.
By Julyus Cesar thy Tour founded of old
May be the hous of Mars victoryall,
Whose artillary with tonge may not be told:
London, thou art the flour of Cities all.
Strong be thy wallis that about thee standis;
Wise be the people that within thee dwellis;
Fresh is thy ryver with his lusty strandis;
Blith be thy chirches, wele sownyng be thy bellis;
Rich be thy merchauntis in substaunce that excellis;
Fair be their wives, right lovesom, white and small;
Clere be thy virgyns, lusty under kellis:
London, thou art the flour of Cities all.
Thy famous Maire, by pryncely governaunce,
With sword of justice thee ruleth prudently.
No Lord of Parys, Venyce, or Floraunce
In dignitye or honour goeth to hym nigh.
He is exampler, loode-ster, and guye;
Principall patrone and rose orygynalle,
Above all Maires as maister most worthy:
London, thou art the flour of Cities all.

ONCE I pass'd through a populous city, imprinting my brain, for
future use, with its shows, architecture, customs, and
traditions;
Yet now, of all that city, I remember only a woman I casually met
there, who detain'd me for love of me;
Day by day and night by night we were together,--All else has long
been forgotten by me;
I remember, I say, only that woman who passionately clung to me;
Again we wander--we love--we separate again;
Again she holds me by the hand--I must not go!
I see her close beside me, with silent lips, sad and tremulous.

Beautiful Ancient City of Perth,
One of the grandest on the earth,
With your stately mansions and streets so clean,
And situated between two Inches green,
Which are most magnificent to be seen
The North Inch is beautiful to behold,
Where the daisies and butter-cups their petals unfold,
In the warm summer time of the year,
While the clear silvery Tay rolls by quite near,
And such a scene will your spirits cheer.
The South Inch is lovely, be it said,
And a splendid spot for military parade,
While along the highway there are some big trees,
Where the soldiers can rest or stand at ease,
Whichever way their commanders please.
The surrounding woodland scenery is very grand,
It cannot be surpassed in fair Scotland,
Especially the elegant Palace of Scone, in history renowned,
Where some of Scotland's kings were crowned.
And the Fair Maid of Perth's house is worthy to be seen,
Which is well worth visiting by Duke, Lord, or Queen;
The Fair Maid of Perth caused the battle on the North Inch
'Twixt the Clans Chattan and Kay, and neither of them did flinch,
Until they were cut up inch by inch.
The scenery is lovely in the month of June,
When trees and flowers are in full bloom,
Especially near by the Palace of Scone,
Where the blackbird is heard whistling all day
While near by rolls on the clear silvery Tay.
Of all the cities in Scotland, beautiful Perth for me,
For it is the most elegant city that ever I did see,
With its beautiful woodland scenery along the river Tay,
Which would make the tourist's heart feel gay,
While fishing for trout on a fine summer day.
There, the angler, if he likes to resort
For a few day's fishing, can have excellent sport,
And while he is fishing during the day,
He will feel delighted with the scenery along the river Tay.
And the fish he catches will drive dull care away,
And his toil will be rewarded for the fatigues of the day.
Beautiful city of Perth, magnificent to be seen,
With your grand statues and Inches green,
And your lovely maidens fair and gay,
Which, in conclusion, I will venture to say,
You cannot be surpassed at the present day.

Would you like to see a city given over,
Soul and body, to a tyrannising game?
If you would, there's little need to be a rover,
For St. Andrews is the abject city's name.
It is surely quite superfluous to mention,
To a person who has been here half an hour,
That Golf is what engrosses the attention
Of the people, with an all-absorbing power.
Rich and poor alike are smitten with the fever;
Their business and religion is to play;
And a man is scarcely deemed a true believer,
Unless he goes at least a round a day.
The city boasts an old and learned college,
Where you'd think the leading industry was Greek;
Even there the favoured instruments of knowledge
Are a driver and a putter and a cleek.
All the natives and the residents are patrons
Of this royal, ancient, irritating sport;
All the old men, all the young men, maids and matrons --
The universal populace, in short.
In the morning, when the feeble light grows stronger,
You may see the players going out in shoals;
And when night forbids their playing any longer,
They tell you how they did the different holes.
Golf, golf, golf -- is all the story!
In despair my overburdened spirit sinks,
Till I wish that every golfer was in glory,
And I pray the sea may overflow the links.
One slender, struggling ray of consolation
Sustains me, very feeble though it be:
There are two who still escape infatuation,
My friend M'Foozle's one, the other's me.
As I write the words, M'Foozle enters blushing,
With a brassy and an iron in his hand ....
This blow, so unexpected and so crushing,
Is more than I am able to withstand.
So now it but remains for me to die, sir.
Stay! There is another course I may pursue --
And perhaps upon the whole it would be wiser --
I will yield to fate and be a golfer too!

A BROADSIDE DISTRIBUTED IN SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS
Censers are swinging,
Over the town;
Censers are swinging,
Look overhead!
Censers are swinging,
Heaven comes down.
City, dead city,
Awake from the dead!
Censers, tremendous,
Gleam overhead.
Wind-harps are ringing,
Wind-harps unseen—
Calling and calling:—
"Wake from the dead.
Rise, little city,
Shine like a queen."
Soldiers of Christ
For battle grow keen.
Heaven-sent winds
Haunt alley and lane.
Singing of life
In town-meadows green
After the toil
And battle and pain.
Incense is pouring
Like the spring rain
Down on the mob
That moil through the street.
Blessed are they
Who behold it and gain
Power made more mighty
Thro' every defeat.
Builders, toil on.
Make all complete.
Make Springfield wonderful.
Make her renown
Worthy this day,
Till, at God's feet,
Tranced, saved forever,
Waits the white town.
Censers are swinging
Over the town,
Censers gigantic!
Look overhead!
Hear the winds singing:—
"Heaven comes down.
City, dead city,
Awake from the dead."

The tired cars go grumbling by,
The moaning, groaning cars,
And the old milk carts go rumbling by
Under the same dull stars.
Out of the tenements, cold as stone,
Dark figures start for work;
I watch them sadly shuffle on,
'Tis dawn, dawn in New York.
But I would be on the island of the sea,
In the heart of the island of the sea,
Where the cocks are crowing, crowing, crowing,
And the hens are cackling in the rose-apple tree,
Where the old draft-horse is neighing, neighing, neighing,
Out on the brown dew-silvered lawn,
And the tethered cow is lowing, lowing, lowing,
And dear old Ned is braying, braying, braying,
And the shaggy Nannie goat is calling, calling, calling
From her little trampled corner of the long wide lea
That stretches to the waters of the hill-stream falling
Sheer upon the flat rocks joyously!
There, oh, there! on the island of the sea,
There would I be at dawn.
The tired cars go grumbling by,
The crazy, lazy cars,
And the same milk carts go rumbling by
Under the dying stars.
A lonely newsboy hurries by,
Humming a recent ditty;
Red streaks strike through the gray of the sky,
The dawn comes to the city.
But I would be on the island of the sea,
In the heart of the island of the sea,
Where the cocks are crowing, crowing, crowing,
And the hens are cackling in the rose-apple tree,
Where the old draft-horse is neighing, neighing, neighing
Out on the brown dew-silvered lawn,
And the tethered cow is lowing, lowing, lowing,
And dear old Ned is braying, braying, braying,
And the shaggy Nannie goat is calling, calling, calling,
From her little trampled corner of the long wide lea
That stretches to the waters of the hill-stream falling
Sheer upon the flat rocks joyously!
There, oh, there! on the island of the sea,
There I would be at dawn.

Ce qui doit m'étonner excite mon courage,
Et ma témérité me conduit au cercueil ;
Je sers une beauté plus dure qu'un écueil,
Et l'amour se conserve où l'espoir fait naufrage.
Aveugle passion, fureur, manie et rage,
Vous faites que j'adore un insensible orgueil.
Le plus cruel abord est comme un doux accueil,
Et j'appelle un mépris un agréable outrage.
J'ai pour toute faveur, et pour rigueur du sort,
Une peine charmante, une amoureuse mort,
Et je fonde la vie en ce qu'elle a de pire.
Mon astre me réduit à la nécessité
De ne respirer point, alors que je soupire,
Et ma seule douleur est ma félicité.

Courage in a wheelchair
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
So wonderful this world is
So strange the life is
And so good God is
Her broad smile lights up the stage
Where she dances without legs
Not a story but a fact of one’s life’s page
People say this world is pitiful
But she says it beautiful
On her world frowns
But she takes it smiles of crown
Her hands are now legs
Her body she whirls, curves and shakes
With living music when plays
Looks like lilies in the dew
And daffodils at play
Rain, hail and snow
Will never turn aside
And my disability, she says
Through dance and smile
I can turn aside
Live a graceful life
And God’s judgement I abide
This is courage, very inspiring
Springing forth from great suffering
For after every sunset there’s a dawn fair
And I call it courage in a wheelchair…………..

Courage is the price that Life exacts
for granting peace.
The soul that knows it not
Knows no release from little things:
Knows not the livid loneliness of fear,
Nor mountain heights where bitter
joy can hear
The sound of wings.
How can life grant us boon of living,
compensate
For dull gray ugliness and pregnant
hate
Unless we dare
The soul's dominion? Each time we
make a choice, we pay
With courage to behold the resistless
day,
And count it fair.

Courage
Let our misfortune be a
runing water!
Our courage borrow
a lava from the wild
Volcano even though
some of our rivers are destined to flow
after we have gone.
We made life precious
we can also turn death
into diamonds, if only
we can let our soul be
a wind far from the eyes
of men.

What does courage mean to me?
What does it mean to you?
To some, a single attribute, others, quite a few,
For courage is a lack of fear, inspired by faith and love,
Love of a person, place, or thing, faith in "our Lord" above.
In time of stress, the "Lord" provides, the strength to overcome,
It's courage! giving special drive! until the goal is won.
When danger threatens life or limb, it's courage to the fore,
A courage known by many names, as: daring! guts! and more.
Whatever name we give this trait, it's valiant! stout! and bold!
In action, it is fortitude, a wonder! to behold.

Life is beautiful...
and ugly
Life is a gift....
we cruise and unleash our potentials...
waits...are the....scrap metals......or diamonds....
Passion is like rivers
water flowing endlessly
You can swim
but don't get drowned.....
Those who struggles gravely in early life
Would comes out a winner
In later life
Caught in the crossfire of.....
entangled past....
you deliberately diminish the agony and pain...
with dignity
A home is a home for the homeless
a great place to live
This whole big things........
living is an illusions..
it will vanished
when we're no longer here
Free flow of passionate ideas that calm a troubled heart....
charming thinking
I’ve the courage...
to write it so great
read...
before going to bed........
before dead..
make it a date....
not too late
.

it takes courage to say life goes on
without knowing where you might end
it takes a lot of courage to achieve what
you want to be in life
it takes more courage to forgive
someone that hurt you
it takes more courage to make a tough decision
when you know you might end up  paying consequences
it take more than courage
to be responsible and honest
it takes more than what you call courage
to be a real man! !

THE martial courage of a day is vain,
An empty noise of death the battle's roar,
If vital hope be wanting to restore,
Or fortitude be wanting to sustain,
Armies or kingdoms. We have heard a strain
Of triumph, how the labouring Danube bore
A weight of hostile corses; drenched with gore
Were the wide fields, the hamlets heaped with slain.
Yet see (the mighty tumult overpast)
Austria a daughter of her Throne hath sold!
And her Tyrolean Champion we behold
Murdered, like one ashore by shipwreck cast,
Murdered without relief. Oh! blind as bold,
To think that such assurance can stand fast!

Women of courage, women of strength ,
Women of faith and devotion.
Mothers of children with spirits so strong
Who may have unbridled imaginations.  REFRAIN: They are women, women of courage
They are Christians, towers of strength.
They are women who put Jesus first in life
Show’ ring His love on all those they greet.  Women with losses, women who love,
Whose strength and whose courage comes from above,
Whether they're mothers; or loving Aunties,
It's plain to see Jesus’ love shines through them.  REFRAIN: They are women, women of courage
They are Christians, towers of strength.
They are women who put Jesus first in life
Show’ring His love on all those they greet.  Women I work with, women I know,
Whether at church, or other places I go.
Women whose spirits are battered by pain,
But Christ lifts them up, and they go on again.  REFRAIN: They are women, women of courage
They are Christians, towers of strength.
They are women who put Jesus first in life
Show’ring His love on all those they greet.

Not have another cigarette, you surely must be jesting
It is my sense of humour that you can only be testing
You obviously don't realise that without them I cannot function
I must have them before breakfast, after dinner and after luncheon
I must have them when I'm anxious and have them when relaxed
I must have them when I'm on the phone and when I smell a rat
I must have them when I concentrate and have them when I rest
I must have them watching television and have them on a quest
I must have them in the daylight and have them when night falls
I must have them when a short time passes or even no time passing at all
I must have them when I see them or when they're out of sight
I must have them first thing in the morning and the very last thing at night
I must have them when I'm talking and have them when I'm breathing
I must have them when I'm walking and have them when I'm sneezing
Do you understand what I am trying to tell you?
I must have them
(Sydney, Australia - 2003)

I wrote this poem when a girl at my school got beaten up by other girls after daring to go for a night out to another village near her own.
I left the house looking for fun
My mum shouted out 'Don't be long.'
I'd suffered before,
Echoes in my head:
'You don't belong! ! you don't belong.! ! '
Love and Hate, do they equate?
I sat on the form, doing the norm:
drinking cider and beer,
unleashing the fear.
Love and Hate, Love and Hate.
Then they arrived, full of pride,
Crazy eyes,
Chanting ' You don't belong! ! you don't belong! ! '
I tried to negate,
I could taste their hate.
'You don't belong, you don't belong.'
The boots went in,
Head started to spin,
'You don't belong, you don't belong.'
When I awoke  mum was there,
Full of despair,
All she said  'I told you don't be long.'
Love and Hate, do they equate?
'Don't be long.' 'You Don't belong.'

all alone in this crazy home trapped in this room
no one here to talk too
but what i hear a whisperin soul
i am not crazy
the walls begin to make strange faces the devil itself
no i am not crazy
where did these scars come from i didnt do this
it was that shadow of darkness
no i'm definitely not crazy
who is dat woman in the bloody white gown
a slit at the throat the fire in her eyes
i am not crazy
docters come to give me my dosage
dead
cut to pieces
blood every where
my insides are my outsides
they said i was crazy
but i'm not i'm insane

Crazy Loneliness Hijacks Memory of a Beautiful Girl
Last night
I missed you so much
I made love to
your nightdress
... passionately.
Now your nightdress
hides from me
slinks under covers and pillows
avoids my eyes.
I can't take another night  without you!
Your nightie can't take another night with me!
I am holding your dresses hostage
threatening them with kisses...caresses
if they make one false move.
Your other clothes
tremble in the wardrobe
...come back to me!

Can’t help, starin’ at you
Wonderin’ what the hell is on you
Can’t help, lookin’ at you
Your thoughtful eyes
Is all I’m thinkin’ of
Refrain:
Boy, you got me on my feet
You make my heart skip a beat
Can you tell me what I feel
Is this love that I’m feeling
Chorus:
Boy, I’m crazy
Tell me, am I crazy
When I let myself fall
When I hardly even know you
Boy, I’m crazy
Tell me that I’m crazy
When I said that love
Won’t have a chance
But why the hell did I give you
The chance of a lifetime
(To love me)
Ooh…
Crazy
Can’t help, fallin’ for you
With just one smile
You melt my worries away
Can’t help, wonderin’ to myself
Why I’m feeling so in love with you
Refrain 2:
Boy, you’re not everything
That I’ve always dreaming
Can you give me all the reasons
Why my heart should feel this way
For you
(Repeat Chorus)
0oh woah
Bridge:
I can’t understand myself
I can’t understand this heart
So why don’t you just
Prove it all to me
That you deserve my everything
When I said that I wouldn’t love again
But now my heart is screaming your name

Going crazy right now
Need some help real bad
He wont leave my mind
And I dont know why
Even after he cheated and lied
No guy could replace this
His causing me so much pain
Yet I know I love him
He plays me like a fool
Says we're over
Than wants a cuddle
It's driving me up the wall
I need to lose him
Get him outta my mind
This just isn't right
I love him to dearly
He doesnt love me
Thats for sure
Im going crazy
He just wont leave
My heart or mind

isn't it crazy how
you cant see things right in front of your eyes
isn't it crazy how
love always seems to slowly die
isn't it crazy how
i fell for you and then fell right back out
isn't it crazy how
your something i can live without
isn't it crazy how
how you put me through a lot
isn't it crazy how
your something i just forgot

I promised to write you a poem
Every day in a year.
Every day a new flower.
I promised to write flowers for you
I promised to write you a fairy tale
Every day in a year.
I promised something new
And I promised to collect it.
I promised to keep you high—
You were afraid you might fall.
I promised my words to your throne
To keep the foundation strong
I promised to write your memory,
And rewrite your thoughts.
I promised not to let you fall,
For my words keep the throne.
And after every promise delivered
We were crazier and did not believe
How easy it was to keep promises
And how easy it is to be crazy.
And after every word became a bird,
And every word became a flower,
We knew how good it is to be crazy—
And you loved my madness
Your fear had no basis.
You were comfortable
In your magnificent role.
We promised we would not stop.
We promised never to stop writing poems.
We promised to keep the words flying.
We promised to keep the throne fresh and alive.
We promised to stay crazy.

They found me one day
wandering the wilderness,
hearing voices.
They found me one day
saying 'I hear voices
as clearly as you hear my voice
in this room
yet no one else hears
so that makes me crazy?
The voices denigrate me.
They deny me
and what I want is for them to go away.
Yet, when they speak
they mock me
saying
'they can't hear us because we are blocking them'
and they think you are crazy- this is what makes
us strong
and you weak.'
I hear these voices
and have to drown them out
so I don't hear.
So I don't hear
So I can sleep.
What I need is someone
who believes me:
they know if someone does
their power
is gone.
Does that make me crazy?
I don't think so..

O you were once wild and beautiful
When summer's rays reclined in your hair
And your Being blazed in valleys and hills.
O you were a force so vital and rare
When brief flashes and fragments of Grace
Pierced the warm, feathered air
And the light of love lit up your face.
When crude flesh and fiery spirit were
Wedded in deepest communal bliss
And your youth's blood morphed into roses
In the sweet Garden of Promise
That once seemed so fruitful and endless.
O you were once wild and beautiful
But now you're a ragged recluse
Degraded by the needle chill;
Lost in a twilight world of absence;
Removed from a world you once infused
With colour and art and consciousness.
Now Innocence has been badly wounded
And Despair corrupts our Sacredness.
Yet I still cling tightly to the vast scope
Of your Vision; in the spectral seas
Of prayer; in the righteous rage of hope
In plagued streets placated by prophecy
Amidst the glitter, neon and concrete;
Amidst bleached ruins of modernity.

Crying inside
But smiling outside is
Best culture!

Lease,
Release!
Please,
With your works;
Culture and Creative Arts!
In your land;
With your style,
With your mind,
Attached with words of peace and love.
Creativity is the key!
With imaginations;
Into another realm with your inner self,
Bringing out surprises! !
Touching the hearts of the people around you.

what inflicts itself
on groups or people when in-
novation ceases

Help yourself to the sun
There’s a bite taken out of it already
The only thing that you’ll become
Serenades to my porch while burning a cross in my backyard
Mother Nature is a cruel cruel soul
Even when your best friend is a tree
The less you hear, well, the better off you are
‘Cause from nine-to-five you’re just part of the machine
And this is the lifetime
You woke up in it just yesterday
And you just want to walk along
Side of a boxed-up mannequin in a chain store
Blending colors in conformity
Does nothing but make a mess for someone else to clean
But if you believe in the other side
You will make it past the dirty grip of society
So do your own thing, and be just who you are
And don’t let anyone tell you that it’s wrong
‘Cause when you’re doing the right thing and doing it your own way
You just might flourish in this land that you can see

To lay blame on another,
Is part of the culture.
Very few will admit that sat,
They resolved their own problems...
With a doing not to have them come back.
Who has not told a lie,
As if for them a truth existed.
And who has not involved someone else,
They knew had been innocent.
Denials are seldom put on trial.
To be judged by a jury interpreting laws.
To then convict someone with a sentence given.
And too many prevail to sit confined in prisons or jails,
Later to be released because of a flaw in a 'system' fails.
It is the culture that feeds delusions that exist.
It is the culture that permits mental illness that exists.
It is the culture many define as not being the way it is.
But its 'is' a culture of self righteous conformists,
And their addiction to conflicts and hypocritical beliefs.
It is the culture that feeds, permits and defines!
All the time.
And it is the culture that defies with excuses made,
To rely on alibis to defend, whether wrong or right...
The actions of its people inside and under church steeples.
Or on the streets where hidden crimes reside to protect,
The ones who lie and try to defect with kept imperfections.
As if not to reflect to affect effectively.

Let us not become bigotry
That shall pain with past history
We need to learn and move
Along peaceful path to prove
See the result of intolerance
Blood flows with no patience
Now men want god's supremacy
As if crown is in danger by almighty
Have we gone mad?
Have we feeling of dead?
Why do we misadventure?
We have lovely future
Tolerance has no option
It has to be strengthened with relation
Human being is to be respected
The tolerance is to be acted
No other culture can replace
If humanity is to win the race
Let people go and profess
The way they like to chase

Open your naive eyes…..,
To the Culture Of Stupidity….,
It’s all around you….,
The Culture Of Stupidity ….! !
No way to escape….,
From the Culture Of Stupidity ….,
It haunts and stalks you…,
The Culture Of Stupidity ….! !
It’s hard to believe it….,
The Culture Of Stupidity ….,
That so many can’t see it….,
The Culture Of Stupidity …! !
As liberals keep shying away…..,
From the overwhelming threat…..,
Of radical terrorism today…..,
How long will The Culture Of Stupidity go on….? ?
My answer is as simple as this….,
The Culture Of Stupidity shall live on…..,
As long as humankind and liberalism will exist…! !

What have I understood
And they taught me not too,
I know nothing about India,
The impregnable northeast of,
Their multi-ethnicity and diverse cultural ethos,
The linguistic variety?
The Bodos, the ethnic and linguistic tribe, of the Brahmaputra valley,
You do not destroy the culture and tradition
Of the Bodos of the Bodoland,
The sons of Bodo,
Making them embroiled in a plot
As for the north Indians' strategic conspiracy.
Their life-style, art of living, health and hygiene,
Let them continue with
Heir own tradition,
The Bodods of the Bodoland,
Living in harmony,
Not with demands
For a separate homeland.
One of the Tibeto-Burmese family, Bodo language
Takes us to across the borders and its fringes,
Crossing over to
The domains far flung, over to
With Brahmoism as
The of faith of the people
Rearing and sustaining them so long.
Their Bagurumba, the traditional dance style,
We still admire the traditional folk dance,
Their weaving and keeping of the loom,
Their art and craft,
Their love of fishing, farming,
Cattle-rearing and piggery.
Assam and its beauty
One can mark it through the note of diversity,
Thesis and anti-thesis,
A hub of inflection and intermixing,
Opening avenues and canopies beyond
Lading to the borders
Far across into Central Asia.

Dance!
Dance!
The priest is yellow with sunflower meal,
He is yellow with corn-meal,
He is yellow as the sun.
Dance!
Dance!
His little bells are ringing,
The bells tinkle like sunlight,
The sun is rising.
Dance!
Dance!
Perhaps I will throw you a basket,
Perhaps I will throw you my heart.
Lift the baskets, dancing,
Lower the baskets, dancing,
We have raised fruits,
Now we dance.
Our shadows are long,
The sunlight is bright between our shadows.
Do you want my basket?
Catch it!
Catch it!
But you cannot catch me,
I am more difficult.

As I drove 'cross town today
To get my Holiday shopping under way
With my car radio tuned in
Classic Rock - - let the dance begin
On comes a Don Henley from 1985
- -'All She Wants to Do Is Dance'- -
Up comes the volume
Down comes all four car windows
Take that you hip-hoppers
Wish I had my old speakers
From my '66 Malibu
Then the lyrics struck me
Maybe I've been watchin'
Too many presidental debates
Maybe just too much CNN
Twenty-four hours a day
I have no idea if this is what
Henley was trying to say
But given the state of America's
Foreign and energy policies
Our refusal to sign
The Kyoto Protocol
Ratified by 170 other countries
To reduce greehouse gases
And our nonplused reaction to that
And the six-year Iraq War
THE IRAQ WAR - -? ? ?
It's our war
Bought and
Paid for
Its cost to date in U.S. dollars
If relevant to you $469,509,480,910
U.S. troups dead
A very relevant 3,865
I said  I'm no sure who Henley
Had on his mind
When he wrote and sang
'All she wants to do is dance'
All I could see in my minds eye
As I drove on
Was my Uncle Sam in a dress
Dancing and wantin' to party
Thats' what Don's song was saying to me
War's in a Surge mode
Demos first 100 days
Are long gone
'And all she wants to do is dance
Rebels being rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance
Molotov cocktails the local drink
They make 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
Carzy people walkin' 'round with blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do
is dance, dance, dance'
We're busy getting ready
To dance through the Holidays
Macy's and Wall Mart
Already playing Siren's song
And all we want to do is dance
'Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street'
All we want to do is dance
And make romance
We want to party
How did Don know
He'd make me pull over
Park my car and listen
To his refrian
And suddenly
Not feel like dancing
**November 17,2007**

Voice unheard in heart beats
Come here and dance
Hear the song of my mind
Dance to my beat in life
Let me hold you close to me
I feel my song is you
I want to sing you play to you
My beautiful song you be
Let me turn you
In step with my life
Move with me to music of life
Dance to pain of life
To joy of reality
The song for us to dance
Your moans of pleasure
Move me to love you
I now want to dance with you
Our finger touch our lip meet
Kissing to beats of jazz before
The blue come down on my soul
On I am coming to be true
To need what you be for me
Let just dance to our song
What the matter I’m the same as
Before your beats is my beat
Come dance with me come need me
I wait for you to know
I am for you only
Dance come dance your story with me
Move to life up and down
Dance with me I need you to dance
The dance of life in song of love

our thoughts are the blooms
and the wind our admirers
in so many ways it blows
and each time it does
the petals put on a different dance
into the world we dance
with friends
for each friend a different attire
i put on to show my appreciation
for every friend a different step
in my dance to show my love

To live life as it is unfolding
under my nose
Right now
To accept myself as I really am
in the core of my being
Right now
To let go of the need to change the way I am
and love myself warts and all
Right now
To move to the rhythms of my true self
and allow myself to feel the tenderness within me
Right now
Life - I offer you my hand
Let's dance...
This poem is inspired by The Dance by Oriah Mountain Dreamer.

THE INDIFFERENT.
COME to the dance with me, come with me, fair one!
Dances a feast-day like this may well crown.
If thou my sweetheart art not, thou canst be so,
But if thou wilt not, we still will dance on.
Come to the dance with me, come with me, fair one!
Dances a feast-day like this may well crown.
THE TENDER.
Loved one, without thee, what then would all feast be?
Sweet one, without thee, what then were the dance?
If thou my sweetheart wert not, I would dance not.
If thou art still so, all life is one feast.
Loved one, without thee, what then would all feasts be?
Sweet one, without thee, what then were the dance?
THE INDIFFERENT.
Let them but love, then, and leave us the dancing!
Languishing love cannot bear the glad dance.
Let us whirl round in the waltz's gay measure,
And let them steal to the dim-lighted wood.
Let them but love, then, and leave us the dancing!
Languishing love cannot bear the glad dance.
THE TENDER.
Let them whirl round, then, and leave us to wander!
Wand'ring to love is a heavenly dance.
Cupid, the near one, o'erhears their deriding,
Vengeance takes suddenly, vengeance takes soon.
Let them whirl round, then, and leave us to wander!
Wand'ring to love is a heavenly dance.

Take the name of the swain, a forlorn witless elf
Who was chang'd to a flow'r for admiring himself.
A part deem'd essential in each lady's dress
With what maidens cry when they wish to say yes.
A lullabye carriage, soft, cozy and light
With the name of the Poet who sang on the night.
The queen of Cairo, all lovely and winning
Whose blandishments ever kept Antony grinning.
The flow'r whose odors unremittingly please:
With the glory of forests, the king of the trees.
To the prince of the fairies, a jealous old knave,
Put the name of the tree that undid Mother Eve.
To finish the whole, add that period of day
When the linnet and thrush to repose hie away.
The initials of these, if adjusted with care.
Will show you the fairest where thousands are fair.
The sweet, pretty graces still hover about her
And Cupid would die with vexation without her.
When she swims in the dance or wherever she goes
She's crowded by witlings, plain-fellows, and beaux
Who throng at her elbow and tread on her toes.
If a pin or a hankerchief happen to fall
To seize on the prise fills with uproar the ball;
Such pulling and hawling & shoving & pushing
As rivals the racket of 'key and the cushion; '
And happy- thrice happy! too happy! the swain
Who can replace the pin or bandana again.
Tho the fellows surround & so humbly adore her
The girls on the contrary cannot endure her;
Her beauty their beauty forever disgraces
And her sweeter face still eclipses their faces-
For no lov'ly girl can a lov'ly girl bear
And fair ones are ever at war with the fair.
(Nancy Crooke)

You are growing old,
And your mind is aging too.
Your eyes are nearly closed,
And your moves are slowing, slowing...
But I still see the beauty
every time you show your dance,
For the ocean,
vast and blue.
I see the history of the world
in every twirl or dive,
It's there - almost gone -
fading, fading...
You seem to know the world,
All emotions and their ways,
For I see it in your dance,
For the ocean,
vast and blue.
So show it,
One more time, your dance,
For the ocean,
vast and blue.

BEHOLD, as goblins dark of mien
And portly tyrants dyed with crime
Change, in the transformation scene,
At Christmas, in the pantomime,
Instanter, at the prompter's cough,
The fairy bonnets them, and they
Throw their abhorred carbuncles off
And blossom like the flowers in May.
- So mankind, to angelic eyes,
So, through the scenes of life below,
In life's ironical disguise,
A travesty of man, ye go:
But fear not: ere the curtain fall,
Death in the transformation scene
Steps forward from her pedestal,
Apparent, as the fairy Queen;
And coming, frees you in a trice
From all your lendings - lust of fame,
Ungainly virtue, ugly vice,
Terror and tyranny and shame.
So each, at last himself, for good
In that dear country lays him down,
At last beloved and understood
And pure in feature and renown.

In my haunting dark, dark dream of scare
Into the depths where none dare
In the darkness of this night mare
The place where I live with fear in the air
Who would dream to venture there
In this dream of darkness despair
I go there without a living care
With nothing at all I wear
No weight upon me to tare
There's no light to see anything anywhere
Yet I travel there carrying burdens, I'm aware
Though my spirit and soul does that tear
I go there without any beware
A place where nothing is fair
Spiralling down an endless set of stair
On my neck, upright stands my hair
With my mind open wide, all of me I bare
To find that I am torn wide open in my lair
Until I'm nothing but blood on a chair
Until I wake with an open eyed stare…

In a dark night, when the light
burning was the burning of love (fortuitous
night, fated, free,--)
as I stole from my dark house, dark
house that was silent, grave, sleeping,--
by the staircase that was secret, hidden,
safe: disguised by darkness (fortuitous
night, fated, free,--)
by darkness and by cunning, dark
house that was silent, grave, sleeping--;
in that sweet night, secret, seen by
no one and seeing
nothing, my only light or
guide
the burning in my burning heart,
night was the guide
to the place where he for whom I
waited, whom I had long ago chosen,
waits: night
brighter than noon, in which none can see--;
night was the guide
sweeter than the sun raw at
dawn, for there the burning bridegroom is
bride
and he who chose at last is chosen.
*
As he lay sleeping on my sleepless
breast, kept from the beginning for him
alone, lying on the gift I gave
as the restless
fragrant cedars moved the restless winds,--
winds from the circling parapet circling
us as I lay there touching and lifting his hair,--
with his sovereign hand, he
wounded my neck-
and my senses, when they touched that, touched nothing...
In a dark night	(there where I
lost myself,--) as I leaned to rest
in his smooth white breast, everything
ceased
and left me, forgotten in the grave of forgotten lilies.

Birds have no consciousness of doom:
Yon thrush that serenades me daily
From scented snow of hawthorn bloom
Would not trill out his glee so gaily,
Could he foretell his songful breath
Would sadly soon be stilled in death.
Yon lambs that frolic on the lea
And incarnate the joy of life,
Would scarce disport them could they see
The shadow of the butcher's knife:
Oh Nature, with your loving ruth,
You spare them knowledge of Dark Truth.
To sad humanity alone,
(Creation's triumph ultimate)
The grimness of the grave is known,
The dusty destiny await . . . .
Oh bird and beast, with joy, elance
Effulgently your ingorance!
Oh man, previsioning the hearse,
With fortitude accept your curse!

I want to sleep the dream of the apples,
to withdraw from the tumult of cemetries.
I want to sleep the dream of that child
who wanted to cut his heart on the high seas.
I don't want to hear again that the dead do not lose their blood,
that the putrid mouth goes on asking for water.
I don't want to learn of the tortures of the grass,
nor of the moon with a serpent's mouth
that labors before dawn.
I want to sleep awhile,
awhile, a minute, a century;
but all must know that I have not died;
that there is a stable of gold in my lips;
that I am the small friend of the West wing;
that I am the intense shadows of my tears.
Cover me at dawn with a veil,
because dawn will throw fistfuls of ants at me,
and wet with hard water my shoes
so that the pincers of the scorpion slide.
For I want to sleep the dream of the apples,
to learn a lament that will cleanse me to earth;
for I want to live with that dark child
who wanted to cut his heart on the high seas.

My soul is dark - Oh! quickly string
The harp I yet can brook to hear;
And let thy gentle fingers fling
Its melting murmurs o'er mine ear.
If in this heart a hope be dear,
That sound shall charm it forth again:
If in these eyes there lurk a tear,
'Twill flow, and cease to burn my brain.
But bid the strain be wild and deep,
Nor let thy notes of joy be first:
I tell thee, minstrel, I must weep,
Or else this heavy heart will burst;
For it hath been by sorrow nursed,
And ached in sleepless silence, long;
And now 'tis doomed to know the worst,
And break at once - or yield to song.

Im lost in my own dark little world,
it has four walls,
a window,
& a door,
Its forever 3am and sleep escapes me once more,
Im doomed to lie here,
with only my conscious as comfort,
& the dark as my friend,
Only i know whats said in the dark,
whats done in the dark,
Im left to myself in the dark,
The sandman,
he is no saviour,
for he has not come tonight,
now i must seek the safety of day,
of light,
Only hell is alike,
with purgatory for dessert,
I can only hope,
for sweet somnium,
Tonight...

Thick overhead
clouds of the monsoon,
a delight to this feverish heart.
Season of rain,
season of uncontrolled whispers---the Dark One's returning!
O swollen heart,
O sky brimming with moisture---
tongued lightning first
and then thunder,
convulsive spatters of rain
and then wind, chasing the summertime heat.
Mira says: Dark One,
I've waited---
it's time to take my songs
into the street.

We grow accustomed to the Dark -
When light is put away -
As when the Neighbor holds the Lamp
To witness her Goodbye -
A Moment -  We uncertain step
For newness of the night -
Then -  fit our Vision to the Dark -
And meet the Road -  erect -
And so of larger -  Darknesses -
Those Evenings of the Brain -
When not a Moon disclose a sign -
Or Star -  come out -  within -
The Bravest -  grope a little -
And sometimes hit a Tree
Directly in the Forehead -
But as they learn to see -
Either the Darkness alters -
Or something in the sight
Adjusts itself to Midnight -
And Life steps almost straight.

Frail the white rose and frail are
Her hands that gave
Whose soul is sere and paler
Than time's wan wave.
Rosefrail and fair -- yet frailest
A wonder wild
In gentle eyes thou veilest,
My blueveined child.

There was such speed in her little body,
And such lightness in her footfall,
It is no wonder her brown study Astonishes us all
Her wars were bruited in our high window.
We looked among orchard trees and beyond
Where she took arms against her shadow,
Or harried unto the pond
The lazy geese, like a snow cloud
Dripping their snow on the green grass,
Tricking and stopping, sleepy and proud,
Who cried in goose, Alas,
For the tireless heart within the little
Lady with rod that made them rise
From their noon apple-dreams and scuttle
Goose-fashion under the skies!
But now go the bells, and we are ready,
In one house we are sternly stopped
To say we are vexed at her brown study,
Lying so primly propped.

Do it as daddy says,
Do that even without ask,
Do it with high expectation,
Do it better, do to… perfection.
With mouth shut,
And feet patting silently,
On these cold tiled floors.
Do it for daddy. And when asked what you’re doing?
Answer exactly as daddy asked?
But never speak up over your whisper,
Or look up at the stars,
Princess, time for bed now,
Do as you’re told.
Ok… ok… goodnight dad.

i looked into my daughters eyes
love and affection i could not hide.
while explaining to her what life meant to me
the tears started to roll very freely.
choked up with emotion that i could not stop
i told her what i struggled for and what i got.
the two most beautiful women in my life
my brown eyed daughter and my wife.
this is what part of life means to me
having my child and my family.
although at times i may not seem to care
for my thoughts may be elsewhere.
my ears may be deaf, and my mind far away
but my love is here to stay.
so when i hear GODS beckoning call
let it be said to one and all.
my indian spirit is with me, 'i will not fall'.
my body may die, but not my soul
for that is something that can't be put in a hole.
my body may die, but not my mind
for that will live throughout all time.
so my daughter, don't you despair
for i will always be right here.
and when you're feeling down and out
think of today and what we talked about.
let your thoughts run free and clear
and you'll feel my presence near.
' from one heart touching another.'

I
Young laughters, and my music! Aye till now
The voice can reach no blending minors near;
'Tis the bird's trill because the spring is here
And spring means trilling on a blossomy bough;
'Tis the spring joy that has no why or how,
But sees the sun and hopes not nor can fear--
Spring is so sweet and spring seems all the year.
Dear voice, the first-come birds but trill as thou.
Oh music of my heart, be thus for long:
Too soon the spring bird learns the later song;
Too soon a sadder sweetness slays content
Too soon! There comes new light on onward day,
There comes new perfume o'er a rosier way:
Comes not again the young spring joy that went.
ROME, November 1881.
II
That she is beautiful is not delight,
As some think mothers joy, by pride of her,
To witness questing eyes caught prisoner
And hear her praised the livelong dancing night;
But the glad impulse that makes painters sight
Bids me note her and grow the happier;
And love that finds me as her worshipper
Reveals me each best loveliness aright.
Oh goddess head! Oh innocent brave eyes!
Oh curved and parted lips where smiles are rare
And sweetness ever! Oh smooth shadowy hair
Gathered around the silence of her brow!
Child, I'd needs love thy beauty stranger-wise:
And oh the beauty of it, being thou!
III
I watch the sweet grave face in timorous thought
Lest I should see it dawn to some unrest
And read that in her heart is youth's ill guest,
The querulous young sadness, born of nought,
That wearies of the strife it has not fought,
And finds the life it has not had unblest,
And asks it knows not what that should be best,
And till Love come has never what it sought.
But she is still. A full and crystal lake
So gives it skies their passage to its deeps
In an unruffled morn where no winds wake,
And, strong and fretless, 'stirs not, nor yet sleeps.
My darling smiles and 'tis for gladness' sake;
She hears a woe, 'tis simple tears she weeps.
IV
'Tis but a child. The quiet Juno gaze
Breaks at a trifle into mirth and glow,
Changed as a folded bud bursts into blow,
And she springs, buoyant, on some busy craze,
Or, in the rhythm of her girlish plays,
Like light upon swift waves floats to and fro,
And, whatsoe'er's her mirth, needs me to know,
And keeps me young by her young innocent ways.
Just now she and her kitten raced and sprang
To catch the daisy ball she tossed about;
Then they grew grave, and found a shady tree,
And kitty tried to see the notes she sang:
Now she flies hitherward--'Mother! Quick! Come see!
Two hyacinths in my garden almost out!'
V
Last night the broad blue lightnings flamed the sky;
We watched, our breaths caught as each burst its way,
And through its fire out-leaped the sharp white ray,
And sudden dark re-closed when it went by:
But she, that where we are will needs be nigh,
Had tired with hunting orchids half the day.
Her father thought she called us; he and I,
Half anxious, reached the bedroom where she lay.
Oh lily face upon the whiteness blent!
How calm she lay in her unconscious grace!
A peal crashed on the silence ere we went;
She stirred in sleep, a little changed her place,
'Mother,' she breathed, a smile grew on her face:
'Mother,' my darling breathed, and slept content.
VI
Sometimes, as young things will, she vexes me,
Wayward, or too unheeding, or too blind.
Like aimless birds that, flying on a wind,
Strike slant against their own familiar tree;
Like venturous children pacing with the sea,
That turn but when the breaker spurts behind
Outreaching them with spray: she in such kind
Is borne against some fault, or does not flee.
And so, may be, I blame her for her wrong,
And she will frown and lightly plead her part,
And then I bid her go. But 'tis not long:
Then comes she lip to ear and heart to heart.
And thus forgiven her love seems newly strong,
And, oh my penitent, how dear thou art!
VII
Her father lessons me I at times am hard,
Chiding a moment's fault as too grave ill,
And let some little blot my vision fill,
Scanning her with a narrow near regard.
True. Love's unresting gaze is self-debarred
From all sweet ignorance, and learns a skill,
Not painless, of such signs as hurt love's will,
That would not have its prize one tittle marred.
Alas! Who rears and loves a dawning rose
Starts at a speck upon one petal's rim:
Who sees a dusk creep in the shrined pearl's glows,
Is ruined at once: 'My jewel growing dim!'
I watch one bud that on my bosom blows,
I watch one treasured pearl for me and him.
VIII
A little child she, half defiant came
Reasoning her case--'twas not so long ago--
'I cannot mind your scolding, for I know
However bad I were you'd love the same.'
And I, what countering answer could I frame?
'Twas true, and true, and God's self told her so.
One does but ask one's child to smile and grow,
And each rebuke has love for its right name.
And yet, methinks, sad mothers who for years,
Watching the child pass forth that was their boast,
Have counted all the footsteps by new fears
Till even lost fears seem hopes whereof they're reft
And of all mother's good love sole is left--
Is their Love, Love, or some remembered ghost?
IX
Oh weary hearts! Poor mothers that look back!
So outcasts from the vale where they were born
Turn on their road and, with a joy forlorn,
See the far roofs below their arid track:
So in chill buffets while the sea grows black
And windy skies, once blue, are tost and torn,
We are not yet forgetful of the morn,
And praise anew the sunshine that we lack.
Oh, sadder than pale sufferers by a tomb
That say 'My dead is happier, and is more'
Are they who dare no 'is' but tell what's o'er--
Thus the frank childhood, those the lovable ways--
Stirring the ashes of remembered days
For yet some sparks to warm the livelong gloom.
X
Love's Counterfeit.
Not Love, not Love, that worn and footsore thrall
Who, crowned with withered buds and leaves gone dry,
Plods in his chains to follow one passed by,
Guerdoned with only tears himself lets fall.
Love is asleep and smiling in his pall,
And this that wears his shape and will not die
Was once his comrade shadow, Memory--
His shadow that now stands for him in all.
And there are those who, hurrying on past reach,
See the dim follower and laugh, content,
'Lo, Love pursues me, go where'er I will!'
Yet, longer gazing, some may half beseech,
'This must be Love that wears his features still:
Or else when was the moment that Love went?'
XI
Love's Mourner.
'Tis men who say that through all hurt and pain
The woman's love, wife's, mother's, still will hold,
And breathes the sweeter and will more unfold
For winds that tear it, and the sorrowful rain.
So in a thousand voices has the strain
Of this dear patient madness been retold,
That men call woman's love. Ah! they are bold,
Naming for love that grief which does remain.
Love faints that looks on baseness face to face:
Love pardons all; but by the pardonings dies,
With a fresh wound of each pierced through the breast.
And there stand pityingly in Love's void place
Kindness of household wont familiar-wise,
And faith to Love--faith to our dead at rest.
XII
She has made me wayside posies: here they stand,
Bringing fresh memories of where they grew.
As new-come travellers from a world we knew
Wake every while some image of their land,
So these whose buds our woodland breezes fanned
Bring to my room the meadow where they blew,
The brook-side cliff, the elms where wood-doves coo--
And every flower is dearer for her hand.
Oh blossoms of the paths she loves to tread,
Some grace of her is in all thoughts you bear:
For in my memories of your homes that were
The old sweet loneliness they kept is fled,
And would I think it back I find instead
A presence of my darling mingling there.
XIII
My darling scarce thinks music sweet save mine:
'Tis that she does but love me more than hear.
She'll not believe my voice to stranger ear
Is merely measure to the note and line;
'Not so,' she says; 'Thou hast a secret thine:
The others' singing's only rich, or clear,
But something in thy tones brings music near;
As though thy song could search me and divine.'
Oh voice of mine that in some day not far
Time, the strong creditor, will call his debt,
Will dull--and even to her--will rasp and mar,
Sing Time asleep because of her regret,
Be twice thy life the thing her fancies are,
Thou echo to the self she knows not yet.
CASERTA, April, 1882.
XIV
To love her as to-day is so great bliss
I needs must think of morrows almost loth,
Morrows wherein the flower's unclosing growth
Shall make my darling other than she is.
The breathing rose excels the bud I wis,
Yet bud that will be rose is sweet for both;
And by-and-by seems like some later troth
Named in the moment of a lover's kiss.
Yes, I am jealous, as of one now strange
That shall instead of her possess my thought,
Of her own self made new by any change,
Of her to be by ripening morrows brought.
My rose of women under later skies!
Yet, ah! my child with the child's trustful eyes!
XV
That some day Death who has us all for jest
Shall hide me in the dark and voiceless mould,
And him whose living hand has mine in hold,
Where loving comes not nor the looks that rest,
Shall make us nought where we are known the best,
Forgotten things that leave their track untold
As in the August night the sky's dropped gold--
This seems no strangeness, but Death's natural hest.
But looking on the dawn that is her face
To know she too is Death's seems mis-belief;
She should not find decay, but, as the sun
Moves mightier from the veil that hides his place,
Keep ceaseless radiance. Life is Death begun:
But Death and her! That's strangeness passing grief.
XVI
She will not have it that my day wanes low,
Poor of the fire its drooping sun denies,
That on my brow the thin lines write good-byes
Which soon may be read plain for all to know,
Telling that I have done with youth's brave show;
Alas! and done with youth in heart and eyes,
With wonder and with far expectancies,
Save but to say 'I knew such long ago.'
She will not have it. Loverlike to me,
She with her happy gaze finds all that's best,
She sees this fair and that unfretted still,
And her own sunshine over all the rest:
So she half keeps me as she'd have me be,
And I forget to age, through her sweet will.
XVII
And how could I grow old while she's so young?
Methinks her heart sets tune for mine to beat,
We are so near; her new thoughts, incomplete,
Find their shaped wording happen on my tongue;
Like bloom on last year's winterings newly sprung
My youth upflowers with hers, and must repeat
Old joyaunces in me nigh obsolete.
Could I grow older while my child's so young?
And there are tales how youthful blood instilled
Thawing frore Age's veins gave life new course,
And quavering limbs and eyes made indolent
Grew freshly eager with beginning force:
She so breathes impulse. Were my years twice spent,
Not burdening Age, with her, could make me chilled.
XVIII
'Tis hard that the full summer of our round
Is but the turn where winter's sign-post's writ;
That to have reached the best is leaving it;
That final loss bears date from having found.
So some proud vessel in a narrow sound
Sails at high water with the fair wind fit,
And lo! the ebb along the sandy spit,
Lower and lower till she jars, aground.
'Tis hard. We are young still but more content;
'Tis our ripe flush, the heyday of our prime;
We learn full breath, how rich of the air we are!
But suddenly we note a touch of time,
A little fleck that scarcely seems to mar;
And we know then that some time since youth went.
XIX
Life on the wane: yes, sudden that news breaks.
And yet I would 'twere suddenly and less soon;
Since no forewarning makes loss opportune.
And now I watch that slow advance Time makes:
Watch as, while silent flow spreads broad the lakes
Mid the land levels of a smooth lagoon,
One waiting, pitiful, on a tidal dune,
Aware too long before it overtakes.
Ah! there's so quick a joy in hues and sun,
And will my eyes see dim? Will vacant sense
Forget the lark, the surges on the beach?
Shall I step wearily and wish 'twere done?
Well, if it be love will not too go hence,
Love will have new glad secrets yet to teach.
XX
There's one I miss. A little questioning maid
That held my finger, trotting by my side,
And smiled out of her pleased eyes open wide,
Wondering and wiser at each word I said.
And I must help her frolics if she played,
And I must feel her trouble if she cried;
My lap was hers past right to be denied;
She did my bidding, but I more obeyed.
Dearer she is to-day, dearer and more;
Closer to me, since sister womanhoods meet;
Yet, like poor mothers some long while bereft,
I dwell on toward ways, quaint memories left,
I miss the approaching sound of pit-pat feet,
The eager baby voice outside my door.
XXI
Hardly in any common tender wise,
With petting talk, light lips on her dear cheek,
The love I mean my child will bear to speak,
Loth of its own less image for disguise;
But liefer will it floutingly devise,
Using a favourite jester's mimic pique,
Prompt, idle, by-names with their sense to seek,
And takes for language laughing ironies.
But she, as when some foreign tongue is heard,
Familiar on our lips and closely known,
We feel the every purport of each word
When ignorant ears reach empty sound alone,
So knows the core within each merry gird,
So gives back such a meaning in her own.
XXII
The brook leaps riotous with its life just found,
That freshets from the mountain rains have fed,
Beats at the boulders in its hindered bed,
And fills the valley with its triumphing sound.
The strong unthirsty tarn sunk in deep ground
Has never a sigh wherewith its wealth is said,
Has no more ripples than the May-flies tread:
Silence of waters is where they abound.
And love, whatever love, sure, makes small boast:
'Tis the new lovers tell, in wonder yet.
Oh happy need! Enriched stream's jubilant gush!
But who being spouses well have learned love's most,
Being child and mother learned not nor forget,
These in their joyfulness feel the tarn's strong hush.
XXIII
Birds sing 'I love you, love' the whole day through,
And not another song can they sing right;
But, singing done with, loving's done with quite,
The autumn sunders every twittering two.
And I'd not have love make too much ado
With sweet parades of fondness and delight,
Lest iterant wont should make caresses trite,
Love-names mere cuckoo ousters of the true.
Oh heart can hear heart's sense in senseless nought,
And heart that's sure of heart has little speech.
What shall it tell? The other knows its thought.
What shall one doubt or question or beseech
Who is assured and knows and, unbesought,
Possesses the dear trust that each gives each.
XXIV
'You scarcely are a mother, at that rate.
Only one child!' The blithe soul pitied loud.
And doubtless she, amid her household crowd,
When one brings care in another's fortunate;
When one fares forth another's at her gate.
Yea, were her first-born folded in his shroud,
Not with a whole despair would she be bowed,
She has more sons to make her heart elate.
Many to love her singly, mother theirs,
To give her the dear love of being their need,
To storm her lap by turns and claim their kiss,
To kneel around her at their bed-time prayers;
Many to grow her comrades! Some have this.
Yet I, I do not envy them indeed.
RAMSGATE, 1886.
XXV
You think that you love each as much as one,
Mothers with many nestlings 'neath your wings.
Nay, but you know not. Love's most priceless things
Have unity that cannot be undone.
You give the rays, I the englobed full sun;
I give the river, you the separate springs:
My motherhood's all my child's with all it brings--
None takes the strong entireness from her: none.
You know not. You love yours with various stress;
This with a graver trust, this with more pride;
This maybe with more needed tenderness:
I by each uttermost passion of my soul
Am turned to mine; she is one, she has the whole:
How should you know who appraise love and divide?
XXVI
Of my one pearl so much more joy I gain
As he that to his sole desire is sworn,
Indifferent what women more were born,
And if she loved him not all love were vain,
Gains more, because of her--yea, through all pain,
All love and sorrows, were they two forlorn--
Than whoso happiest in the lands of morn
Mingles his heart amid a wifely train.
Oh! Child and mother, darling! Mother and child!
And who but we? We, darling, paired alone?
Thou hast all thy mother; thou art all my own.
That passion of maternity which sweeps
Tideless 'neath where the heaven of thee hath smiled
Has but one channel, therefore infinite deeps.
XXVII
Since first my little one lay on my breast
I never needed such a second good,
Nor felt a void left in my motherhood
She filled not always to the utterest.
The summer linnet, by glad yearnings pressed,
Builds room enough to house a callow brood:
I prayed not for another child--nor could;
My solitary bird had my heart's nest.
But she is cause that any baby thing
If it but smile, is one of mine in truth,
And every child becomes my natural joy:
And, if my heart gives all youth fostering,
Her sister, brother, seems the girl or boy:
My darling makes me mother to their youth.

Who will wed the Dowager’s youngest daughter,
The Captain? filled with ale?
He moored his expected boat to a stake in the water
And stumbled on sea-legs into the Hall for mating,
Only to be seduced by her lady-in-waiting,
Round-bosomed, and not so pale.
Or the thrifty burgher in boots and fancy vest
With considered views of marriage?
By the tidy scullery maid he was impressed
Who kept that house from depreciation and dirt,
But wife does double duty and takes no hurt,
So he rode her home in his carriage.
Never the spare young scholar antiquary
Who was their next resort;
They let him wait in the crypt of the Old Library
And found him compromised with a Saxon book,
Claiming his truelove Learning kept that nook
And promised sweet disport.
Desirée (of a mother’s christening) never shall wed
Though fairest child of her womb;
“We will have revenge,” her injured Ladyship said,
“Henceforth the tightest nunnery be thy bed
By the topmost stair! When the ill-bred lovers come
We’ll say, She is not at home.”

O thou, the wonder of all days!
O paragon, and pearl of praise!
O Virgin-martyr, ever blest
Above the rest
Of all the maiden-train!  We come,
And bring fresh strewings to thy tomb.
Thus, thus, and thus, we compass round
Thy harmless and unhaunted ground;
And as we sing thy dirge, we will
The daffadil,
And other flowers, lay upon
The altar of our love, thy stone.
Thou wonder of all maids, liest here,
Of daughters all, the dearest dear;
The eye of virgins; nay, the queen
Of this smooth green,
And all sweet meads, from whence we get
The primrose and the violet.
Too soon, too dear did Jephthah buy,
By thy sad loss, our liberty;
His was the bond and cov'nant, yet
Thou paid'st the debt;
Lamented Maid!  he won the day:
But for the conquest thou didst pay.
Thy father brought with him along
The olive branch and victor's song;
He slew the Ammonites, we know,
But to thy woe;
And in the purchase of our peace,
The cure was worse than the disease.
For which obedient zeal of thine,
We offer here, before thy shrine,
Our sighs for storax, tears for wine;
And to make fine
And fresh thy hearse-cloth, we will here
Four times bestrew thee every year.
Receive, for this thy praise, our tears;
Receive this offering of our hairs;
Receive these crystal vials, fill'd
With tears, distill'd
From teeming eyes; to these we bring,
Each maid, her silver filleting,
To gild thy tomb; besides, these cauls,
These laces, ribbons, and these falls,
These veils, wherewith we use to hide
The bashful bride,
When we conduct her to her groom;
All, all we lay upon thy tomb.
No more, no more, since thou art dead,
Shall we e'er bring coy brides to bed;
No more, at yearly festivals,
We, cowslip balls,
Or chains of columbines shall make,
For this or that occasion's sake.
No, no; our maiden pleasures be
Wrapt in the winding-sheet with thee;
'Tis we are dead, though not i' th' grave;
Or if we have
One seed of life left, 'tis to keep
A Lent for thee, to fast and weep.
Sleep in thy peace, thy bed of spice,
And make this place all paradise;
May sweets grow here, and smoke from hence
Fat frankincense;
Let balm and cassia send their scent
From out thy maiden-monument.
May no wolf howl, or screech owl stir
A wing about thy sepulchre!
No boisterous winds or storms come hither,
To starve or wither
Thy soft sweet earth; but, like a spring,
Love keep it ever flourishing.
May all shy maids, at wonted hours,
Come forth to strew thy tomb with flowers;
May virgins, when they come to mourn,
Male-incense burn
Upon thine altar; then return,
And leave thee sleeping in thy urn.

SHE is yet a child in years,
Twelve springs are on her face,
Yet in her slender form appears
The woman's perfect grace.
Her silken hair, that glossy black,
But only to be found
There, or upon the raven's back,
Falls sweeping to the ground.
'Tis parted in two shining braids
With silver and with gold,
And one large pearl by contrast aids
The darkness of each fold.
And for she is so young, that flowers
Seem natural to her now,
There wreaths the champac's snowy showers
Around her sculptured brow.
Close to her throat the silvery vest
By shining clasps is bound,
Scarce may her graceful shape be guest,
Mid drapery floating round.
But the small curve of that veined throat,
Like marble, but more warm,
The fairy foot and hand denote
How perfect is the form.
Upon the ankle and the wrist
There is a band of gold,
No step by Grecian fountain kiss'd,
Was of diviner mould.
In the bright girdle round her waist,
Where the red rubies shine,
The kandjar's glittering hilt is placed,
To mark her royal line.
Her face is like the moonlight pale,
Strangely and purely fair,
For never summer sun nor gale
Has touched the softness there.
There are no colours of the rose,
Alone the lip is red;
No blush disturbs the sweet repose
Which o'er that cheek is shed.
And yet the large black eyes, like night,
Have passion and have power;
Within their sleepy depths is light
For some wild wakening hour.
A world of sad and tender dreams
'Neath those long lashes sleep,
A native pensiveness that seems
Too still and sweet to weep.
Of such seclusion know we nought:
Yet surely woman here
Grows shrouded from all common thought,
More delicate and dear.
And love, thus made a thing apart,
Must seem the more divine,
When the sweet temple of the heart
Is a thrice-veiled shrine.

Bles't bee thy Name, who did'st restore
To health my Daughter dear
When death did seem ev'n to approach,
And life was ended near.
Gravnt shee remember what thov'st done,
And celebrate thy Praise;
And let her Conversation say,
Shee loues thee all thy Dayes.

I DREAMED that one had died in a strange place
Near no accustomed hand,
And they had nailed the boards above her face,
The peasants of that land,
Wondering to lay her in that solitude,
And raised above her mound
A cross they had made out of two bits of wood,
And planted cypress round;
And left her to the indifferent stars above
Until I carved these words:
i{She was more beautiful than thy first love,}
i{But now lies under boards.}

Never until the mankind making
Bird beast and flower
Fathering and all humbling darkness
Tells with silence the last light breaking
And the still hour
Is come of the sea tumbling in harness
And I must enter again the round
Zion of the water bead
And the synagogue of the ear of corn
Shall I let pray the shadow of a sound
Or sow my salt seed
In the least valley of sackcloth to mourn
The majesty and burning of the child's death.
I shall not murder
The mankind of her going with a grave truth
Nor blaspheme down the stations of the breath
With any further
Elegy of innocence and youth.
Deep with the first dead lies London's daughter,
Robed in the long friends,
The grains beyond age, the dark veins of her mother,
Secret by the unmourning water
Of the riding Thames.
After the first death, there is no other.

976
Death is a Dialogue between
The Spirit and the Dust.
"Dissolve" says Death—The Spirit "Sir
I have another Trust"—
Death doubts it—Argues from the Ground—
The Spirit turns away
Just laying off for evidence
An Overcoat of Clay.

Come thou, thou last one, whom I recognize,
unbearable pain throughout this body's fabric:
as I in my spirit burned, see, I now burn in thee:
the wood that long resisted the advancing flames
which thou kept flaring, I now am nourishinig
and burn in thee.
My gentle and mild being through thy ruthless fury
has turned into a raging hell that is not from here.
Quite pure, quite free of future planning, I mounted
the tangled funeral pyre built for my suffering,
so sure of nothing more to buy for future needs,
while in my heart the stored reserves kept silent.
Is it still I, who there past all recognition burn?
Memories I do not seize and bring inside.
O life! O living! O to be outside!
And I in flames. And no one here who knows me.

.  When first, descending from the moorlands,
I saw the Stream of Yarrow glide
Along a bare and open valley,
The Ettrick Shepherd was my guide.
When last along its banks I wandered,
Through groves that had begun to shed
Their golden leaves upon the pathways,
My steps the Border-minstrel led.
The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer,
'Mid mouldering ruins low he lies;
And death upon the braes of Yarrow,
Has closed the Shepherd-poet's eyes:
Nor has the rolling year twice measured,
From sign to sign, its stedfast course,
Since every mortal power of Coleridge
Was frozen at its marvellous source;
The rapt One, of the godlike forehead,
The heaven-eyed creature sleeps in earth:
And Lamb, the frolic and the gentle,
Has vanished from his lonely hearth.
Like clouds that rake the mountain-summits,
Or waves that own no curbing hand,
How fast has brother followed brother,
From sunshine to the sunless land!
Yet I, whose lids from infant slumber
Were earlier raised, remain to hear
A timid voice, that asks in whispers,
"Who next will drop and disappear?"
Our haughty life is crowned with darkness,
Like London with its own black wreath,
On which with thee, O Crabbe! forth-looking,
I gazed from Hampstead's breezy heath.
As if but yesterday departed,
Thou too art gone before; but why,
O'er ripe fruit, seasonably gathered,
Should frail survivors heave a sigh?
Mourn rather for that holy Spirit,
Sweet as the spring, as ocean deep;
For Her who, ere her summer faded,
Has sunk into a breathless sleep.
No more of old romantic sorrows,
For slaughtered Youth or love-lorn Maid!
With sharper grief is Yarrow smitten,
And Ettrick mourns with her their Poet dead.

Perhaps if Death is kind, and there can be returning,
We will come back to earth some fragrant night,
And take these lanes to find the sea, and bending
Breathe the same honeysuckle, low and white.
We will come down at night to these resounding beaches
And the long gentle thunder of the sea,
Here for a single hour in the wide starlight
We shall be happy, for the dead are free.
Submitted by Venus

We lack all knowledge of this parting. Death
does not deal with us. We have no reason
to show death admiration, love or hate;
his mask of feigned tragic lament gives us
a false impression. The world's stage is still
filled with roles which we play. While we worry
that our performances may not please,
death also performs, although to no applause.
But as you left us, there broke upon this stage
a glimpse of reality, shown through the slight
opening through which you dissapeared: green,
evergreen, bathed in sunlight, actual woods.
We keep on playiing, still anxious, our difficult roles
declaiming, accompanied by matching gestures
as required. But your presence so suddenly
removed from our midst and from our play, at times
overcomes us like a sense of that other
reality: yours, that we are so overwhelmed
and play our actual lives instead of the performance,
forgetting altogehter the applause.
Translated by Albert Ernest Flemming

Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table
Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,
She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage
To meet him in the doorway with the news
And put him on his guard. "Silas is back."
She pushed him outward with her through the door
And shut it after her. "Be kind," she said.
She took the market things from Warren's arms
And set them on the porch, then drew him down
To sit beside her on the wooden steps.
"When was I ever anything but kind to him?
But I'll not have the fellow back," he said.
"I told him so last haying, didn't I?
'If he left then,' I said, 'that ended it.'
What good is he? Who else will harbour him
At his age for the little he can do?
What help he is there's no depending on.
Off he goes always when I need him most.
'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,
Enough at least to buy tobacco with,
So he won't have to beg and be beholden.'
'All right,' I say, 'I can't afford to pay
Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.'
'Someone else can.' 'Then someone else will have to.'
I shouldn't mind his bettering himself
If that was what it was. You can be certain,
When he begins like that, there's someone at him
Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,--
In haying time, when any help is scarce.
In winter he comes back to us. I'm done."
"Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you," Mary said.
"I want him to: he'll have to soon or late."
"He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove.
When I came up from Rowe's I found him here,
Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,
A miserable sight, and frightening, too--
You needn't smile--I didn't recognise him--
I wasn't looking for him--and he's changed.
Wait till you see."
"Where did you say he'd been?"
"He didn't say. I dragged him to the house,
And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.
I tried to make him talk about his travels.
Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off."
"What did he say? Did he say anything?"
"But little."
"Anything? Mary, confess
He said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me."
"Warren!"
" ;But did he? I just want to know."
"Of course he did. What would you have him say?
Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man
Some humble way to save his self-respect.
He added, if you really care to know,
He meant to clear the upper pasture, too.
That sounds like something you have heard before?
Warren, I wish you could have heard the way
He jumbled everything. I stopped to look
Two or three times--he made me feel so queer--
To see if he was talking in his sleep.
He ran on Harold Wilson--you remember--
The boy you had in haying four years since.
He's finished school, and teaching in his college.
Silas declares you'll have to get him back.
He says they two will make a team for work:
Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!
The way he mixed that in with other things.
He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft
On education--you know how they fought
All through July under the blazing sun,
Silas up on the cart to build the load,
Harold along beside to pitch it on."
"Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot."
"Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.
You wouldn't think they would. How some things linger!
Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him.
After so many years he still keeps finding
Good arguments he sees he might have used.
I sympathise. I know just how it feels
To think of the right thing to say too late.
Harold's associated in his mind with Latin.
He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying
He studied Latin like the violin
Because he liked it--that an argument!
He said he couldn't make the boy believe
He could find water with a hazel prong--
Which showed how much good school had ever done him.
He wanted to go over that. But most of all
He thinks if he could have another chance
To teach him how to build a load of hay----"
"I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment.
He bundles every forkful in its place,
And tags and numbers it for future reference,
So he can find and easily dislodge it
In the unloading. Silas does that well.
He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests.
You never see him standing on the hay
He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself."
"He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be
Some good perhaps to someone in the world.
He hates to see a boy the fool of books.
Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk,
And nothing to look backward to with pride,
And nothing to look forward to with hope,
So now and never any different."
Part of a moon was falling down the west,
Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.
Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw
And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand
Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,
Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,
As if she played unheard the tenderness
That wrought on him beside her in the night.
"Warren," she said, "he has come home to die:
You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time."
"Home," he mocked gently.
"Yes, what else but home?
It all depends on what you mean by home.
Of course he's nothing to us, any more
Than was the hound that came a stranger to us
Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail."
"Home is the place where, when you have to go there,
They have to take you in."
"I should have called it
Something you somehow haven't to deserve."
Warren leaned out and took a step or two,
Picked up a little stick, and brought it back
And broke it in his hand and tossed it by.
"Silas has better claim on us you think
Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles
As the road winds would bring him to his door.
Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day.
Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich,
A somebody--director in the bank."
"He never told us that."
"We know it though."
"I think his brother ought to help, of course.
I'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right
To take him in, and might be willing to--
He may be better than appearances.
But have some pity on Silas. Do you think
If he'd had any pride in claiming kin
Or anything he looked for from his brother,
He'd keep so still about him all this time?"
"I wonder what's between them."
"I can tell you.
Silas is what he is--we wouldn't mind him--
But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide.
He never did a thing so very bad.
He don't know why he isn't quite as good
As anyone. He won't be made ashamed
To please his brother, worthless though he is."
"I can't think Si ever hurt anyone."
"No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay
And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back.
He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge.
You must go in and see what you can do.
I made the bed up for him there to-night.
You'll be surprised at him--how much he's broken.
His working days are done; I'm sure of it."
"I'd not be in a hurry to say that."
"I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself.
But, Warren, please remember how it is:
He's come to help you ditch the meadow.
He has a plan. You mustn't laugh at him.
He may not speak of it, and then he may.
I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud
Will hit or miss the moon."
It hit the moon.
Then there were three there, making a dim row,
The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.
Warren returned--too soon, it seemed to her,
Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.
"Warren," she questioned.
"Dead," was all he answered.

Many ask, if I'm high,
Many ask, if I'm low,
Many ask, why are you so happy?
And many ask, why are you so sad?
Many questions asked, and I don't answer,
Many don't ask questions, and I'm left to question myself,
Many ask, what's wrong with you?
And many ask, what's wrong?
Many seem confused, but I don't care,
Many don't care, and now I'm confused.
Many wonder,
Many care,
Many laugh,
As I breathe for air.
Many know me, and I couldn't care less,
Many don't know me, and now I couldn't care more.
For those who don't know me,
I'm full of ups and downs,
Twists and turns,
Lefts and rights,
Many roller coaster rides.
My energy goes up and down,
My brain twists and turns,
My mood swings from left to right,
And then from right to left,
And then once more just a couple more times,
It's like a never-ending pendulum.
I think of life as an emotional roller coaster ride,
That has no beginning,
And has no middle,
And most of all has no ending.
Confused much?
I would think so...
But do you understand...
...What it's like to live with Bipolar Depression? ...

I read this quote
“Depression is anger without enthusiasm.”
I don’t believe that for a second,
I think depression is loneliness,
Feeling so lonely inside
Even if the world surrounds you
And knowing you cant blame anyone but yourself
But that’s just me.
And even worse
When the people you’d think know you best,
Don’t even notice.
Depression to me is
An overwhelming feeling
of defeat
Feeling that somehow,
In a game, you verses life
You lose
And there is no
Double or nothing
Or a such thing as re-do’s
Some of us accept it
And try other strategies
Others are left
Only to dwell
On what tactics they could have changed.

Oh horid ways of emotions.
All actions tryed are of no use.
All actions acted are usless.
No matter the action its all in vain.
I cant go anywhere
Running is usless and of no point.
I cant go no where.
Even if the option were open.
Oh depression horrible depression
Hold me back ever more
Pin me down with the force of your grace.
Depression my one true friend.
A sad dark and lonely place.
Sit upon the walls.
Its so sad and vacant.
Vacant like my happy days.
Depression takes me
More and more each day.
Feeding on my sadness.
This is an everelasting scar
A scar not to heal
A scar not to mend.
It will bring me to my end

Depression is running through my head,
These thoughts make me think of death,
A darkness which blanks my mind,
A walk through the graveyard, what can I find?
Black shadows walk in between the graves,
How many lives have not been saved?
Six feet under if not more,
How I’d like to go down and explore,
The feeling of lying in a box,
I can’t get out, is it locked?
Is it day or is it night?
Are birds singing or have bats taken to flight?
I know one day this is where I’ll go,
Am I afraid? I don’t think so!
Will I be able to explore the feeling of death?
After I’ve taken my last breath?
Or will I be a shadow in between the graves?
Will I know how many lives have not been saved?
After this life is there another one?
With a different moon and a different sun,
I won’t go to hell as I’m already there,
A place full of sadness, a place full of despair,
So there’s nothing to live for, no future no past,
So I might as well end it, end this life at last.

Depression.  Not darkness of living,
but absolute absence of motivation
weighed down by stark self examination -
neither blame nor call for self forgiving.
Mistake.  Little take and far less giving.
Life lead as conditional probation -
sentence to be served, with condemnation
implicit self-destruction.  Misgiving
lies leitmotif, lost life light, life, t[h]rust thieving
til one’s ends met bear no perceived relation
to pain's sharp stings, while alter[c]ation
is seen upon reflection as outliving
hope's scope in time, as atrophy begins
to paralyse - no roses, violins...

The world is falling
I can't seem to keep in reality
my life is growing dim
I can't see from behind me
My thoughts race
All I feel is pain
and of course parents say
no pain no gain
but this pain is different
it hurts my heart
it has and it hurts
inside my heart
What is this pain
that I feel inside
that is called depression
and that's what you are trying to hide
I constantly think of bad things
like sadness and lonlyness
but that isn't the word
the right word is depressed
but why am I depressed
I am as happy as I can be
but on the inside you hurt
and it's depression you see
The only way out
of this dreadful hell
is to try and heal
what is making you dwell
But I don't know
what could it be?
well it could be
my father drinking?
yes that's it
I have found the key
to me being depressed is my dad
and his drinking
so now what do I do
Hell is so bad
well you need to go
and talk to your dad
I know it seems hard
and you are scared
but don't be afraid
if he loves you then he cares
So that's what I did
and I am no longer sad
but I can tell you one thing
I am no longer in hell... and no longer sad
so now I feel better
and you should to
and when you find out why
what are you going to do?
Do what's right
it comes out for the best
and then you feel happy
and no longer a mess

I fear my little child.
I fear that she will not feed and grow strong and healthy,
I fear that she will stop breathing when I am out of the room or selfishly asleep,
I fear that she will become ill because of something I have done or did not do,
I fear that she will be in pain and I will not know why.
I fear that her father will reject her,
I fear that her father will reject me,
I fear that her father will compete for her love and that she will love him more,
I fear that her father will be distant and that she will not love him enough.
I fear that others will think that I am incompetent,
I fear that others will assume that I am capable,
I fear that others will force upon me unhelpful or unwanted advice,
I fear that others will believe I can cope.
I fear the loneliness of endless days without contact,
I fear the emptiness of endless nights without love,
I fear the weakness of endless days without proper meals,
I fear the weariness of endless nights without sleep.
I fear inexperience.
I fear uncertainty.
I fear guilt.
I fear despair.
I fear my little child.

Depression is a fact of life for me.
As much a part of life as food and air,
It hovers like a dreaded entity.
It scatters joys like useless stale debris,
And sews the ashes of my dreams in gloom.
Depression is a fact of life for me.
It poises like a shadowing banshee
With somber wings just waiting to enshroud.
It hovers like a dreaded entity,
And I can almost always guarantee
Secreted in my spectral holidays
Depression is a fact of life for me.
My life becomes a frequent abductee
Purloined by mirthless bird of prey
It hovers like a dreaded entity..
A vulture pouncing when my back is turned,
But hidden, and not easily discerned.
Depression is a fact of life for me
It hovers like a dreaded entity.

we say we will
spend some time
for the season
take a walk in
the autumn groove
enjoy the trees
the leaves and
the soft rustle
at our feet
that gently bids
goodbye to another
season of gold and amber
we never let it
dig our heart
to catch a leaf or two
they fall, resigned
to the fact that
we will never
have time
trail the last wind
and listlessly
to the ground
like jilted lovers
soon the snow will
bury them and our wish
to explore the season
Spring will see us
caught up with another year
like fish in a net with the water
just inches away

When despair comes knocking
There’s no one home
Gone out shopping
And not alone
Despair comes knocking
Every damn week
I try not to care
But he still leaves me weak
But despair comes knocking
Every single day
I keep shooing him off
And sending him away
Despair comes knocking
But what does he want?
Is he here to stay?
Or just here to taunt?
(Itajaí - 27 February,2009)

No longer believe in hopes
I breathe the air of numbness
When my cold heart melts
Aches shall crush it in pieces.

The darkness of the night bewildering
Falls on a world of chaos, and alone
I lie, and listen for the single string
Of Hope, with strainèd ears, but hear no moan
Nor any sound, save only the dull beat
Of my starved heart, that totters on the brink
Of abjectness, reason dethroned, her seat
Usurped by folly. Dear God! let me sink
Forever out of sight in nothingness,
As crazed stars fall from heaven. Woe is me!
Is death too merciful for my distress?
Or does my pain mean nothing unto Thee?
Life's stony road I've suffered passing well,
Now its lone sign-post points to my soul's hell.

Despair's cruel fingertips crawl over the heart of my church.
I witness it's demise as my world crumbles.
When all hope is locked up in enemy dungeons, I pray.
With a hand of faith that proudly stood by my side,
I pray, for the weak, to make them stronger,
For the scared, to make them fearsome
And for all that remains pure...

Lose not faith in your hour of despair.
Since the beginning of man, the
darkness has always been followed
by the light.

FROM THE NOVEL OF EMMELINE.
THOU spectre of terrific mien!
Lord of the hopeless heart and hollow eye,
In whose fierce train each form is seen
That drives sick Reason to insanity!
I woo thee with unusual prayer,
'Grim visaged, comfortless Despair:'
Approach; in me a willing victim find,
Who seeks thine iron sway--and calls thee kind!
Ah! hide for ever from my sight
The faithless flatterer Hope--whose pencil, gay,
Portrays some vision of delight,
Then bids the fairy tablet fade away;
While in dire contrast, to mine eyes,
Thy phantoms, yet more hideous, rise,
And Memory draws from Pleasure's wither'd flower,
Corrosives for the heart--of fatal power!
I bid the traitor Love adieu!
Who to this fond believing bosom came,
A guest insidious and untrue,
With Pity's soothing voice--in Friendship's name;
The wounds he gave, nor Time shall cure,
Nor Reason teach me to endure.
And to that breast mild Patience pleads in vain,
Which feels the curse--of meriting its pain.
Yet not to me, tremendous Power!
Thy worst of spirit-wounding pangs impart,
With which, in dark conviction's hour,
Thou strik'st the guilty unrepentant heart;
But of illusion long the sport,
That dreary, tranquil gloom I court,
Where my past errors I may still deplore,
And dream of long-lost happiness no more!
To thee I give this tortured breast,
Where Hope arises but to foster pain;
Ah! lull its agonies to rest!
Ah! let me never be deceived again!
But callous, in thy deep repose,
Behold, in long array, the woes
Of the dread future, calm and undismay'd,
Till I may claim the hope--that shall not fade!

Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
The better angel is a man right fair,
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.
To win me soon to hell, my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side,
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
And whether that my angel be turned fiend,
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
But being both from me both to each friend,
I guess one angel in another's hell.
Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
Till my bad angel fire my good one out.

Lost and trapped in the valley of nothing but despair
Hands held high for help and grasping nothing but air
Alone and much abandoned no one knows you're there
All have turned their backs and none seems to care
You can choose to stay down and wallow in your sorrow
Or speak words that says there is always a tomorrow
Then you will see the sunshine on a bright new day
Rise up from the valley no matter what they say
When others try their best to keep you burdened down
Rise high above their heads with a smile and not a frown
The life that you want to live is solely up to you
So get up shake off the dust and start your life anew
Despair like a vine can creep back into your life again
Loosen its hold and see the sunshine and not the rain
If you know of someone else whose back is to the ground
Take their hands and lift them up for you was also down

When the life blossoms
Destiny engraved in our lives
When virtue and vice sway to and fro
Energized and driven by supernatural forces
When we are grown up
Our lives started to face challenges
When we encounter distress
Our lives impregnated with tears and worries
That is the destiny of our lives.......
Sometimes our lives tinged and
Embroilled with joys and sorrows
Destiny inflicting poison and evil into our lives
Destiny can make or mar our lives
Destiny inspires our lives to prosperity
It can perish our prospects
Fortune and fate tossing each other
End of lives salunated with blessings

I live life because life lives me,
I try to see the real meaning
Of the lives that we lead,
Each time I search,
All I seem to see,
is a mirror with an image
reflecting me.
Is fate a truth
or just a word that we use
whenever were in doubt,
is this the excuse
guilt is a feeling,
that we experience through time.
any way we deal with it
it wont disappear from life.
happiness is great,
so long as it doesn’t change,
we feel good inside,
but what makes us feel this way.
how long is it,
before the greatness goes away,
Is it the falling of the rain,
or a bad day.
Where do I search for the words that I need,
to express all the emotions I forget to relieve,
intelligence means nothing,
I should know
it doesn’t take a genius to show how they feel.
Time can only tell
where our lives will ever go,
we cant do anythng
but see it for ourselves.

I now gaze fixedly and intently  upon our predetermined destiny and realize that  our love is nothing but a perversion of reality, A distortion of equality, nothing but a cataclysmic consequence of infatuation.
I  foresee the dark ahead even as we lay enervated by our unsheathed passion and as the incandescent glow of our love begins to  attenuate i realize this is our destiny our never ending legacy.
I now lament that which is our destiny for it is not that of which i had envisioned for us, now i fear our destiny is sealed as the wheels of fate conspire to rob us of our eternal desire.the life we shared smolders in the ashes of our future. This is to be our destiny

Down the road of destiny
you see your future life
you see your future children
and you see your future wife
Walking down your path of fate
you lose grasp of all your dreams
you cant find your accomplishments
you lose site of everything
Which path to take, you cant decide
but now you have to choose
on one its what you gain that counts
and the other its what you lose
You must pick now, your time is up
which road will you now take?
maybe the path of destiny
or even the path of fate.
Life or death.......which matters most
you should've thought before,
before you decided to get drunk
and you drove down to the store.
You knew that it was comming
your mom said dont drink and drive
maybe you should've listened
and you might still be alive.

Freedom is my birth right!
I feel if the world would revolve on its own beat and spin......
It is beautiful in its own.....
Man  must learn to accept realities as they are
Face it on the face
With acceptance walk his path
This solves most problems in its root
It is influencing
Trying to influence
To dream
Creating virtual reality
That is man's birth
On earth
Some create with tools'
Some with action
Others with money
few with words
Each soul born
Leaves his mark
The circle of influence may vary
Each soul
must his burden
He alone bear
No love
Can barrow pain
Sharing and caring
Is making this stay a heaven
Holding grudges and competing
Enhances productivity and negativity
Duality is here for eternity
you may or may not acknowledge
Change is constant
For man is for ever evolving.......
You too must change
as must I.
Choice is  that which determines destiny!
I create my own destiny!

I think I know surely where I 'm living
though my thought's full with uncertainty
days and nights pass away  unfriendly
without doing anything
to decrease temperature of my heart
Which was scattered by a girl
or an animal
or my bosom friend.
Angry wind and rain
and the spears and knives  from the Satan's hands
cannot make to weaken
the strength and soul of my life
though they live together with in me
even in my  dreams.
They will blame me
if I show my love on the air
as the light of the little star
of the darkest night
but I'll say and to for someone as I can
because you have your troubles enough
as long as
you're something of the universe.
Very quickly
leaves dry out
and flowers wither
when the sun shines the most brightly
but I'm neither the leaves nor flowers
so, I 'll go on my way
for long nights and days
across the oceans and sparks
to please  the weary and wretched hearts.

An there still stands the tall oak tree, where
a heart is etched and our names they be.

They shalt never fade away. Just as our love
'tis here to stay.

Our love is strong an keeps on growing
branching out and forever flowing.

Soaring above the heavenly sky so high.
This shall be '' our destiny '' and against

And when the clock struck twelve midnight,
Fourteenth, august, forty-seven,
An Asian nation turned awake,
While world slept on in slumber deep!
A hundred years of freedom fight
Came to a grinding halt that night,
As Pandit Nehru gave his speech,
‘Tryst with destiny’ with reach!
India awoke to freedom life,
Despite a hundred years of strife,
And took a pledge anew to stay
A nation, free with peace each day!
That moment was so rare indeed;
A nation’s soul was stirred to lead,
And show the world its powerful seed,
As nations totally paid heed.
India’s history thus saw a dawn:
A struggle great ended that morn,
As success finally newborn,
Did Motherland with pride adorn.
With freedom came newer duties;
The failures of the past did cease;
The country was given new lease –
A cure for this strange a disease!
The nation was a sovereign state,
On that magical hour and date;
As leaders vowed to change the fate
Of Indian people’s long a wait.
A star of freedom rose in east,
Heralding celebration, feast;
A hope anew was born that day,
To never cease, oh, come what may!
The star would never set at all –
The Nation’s Father’s clarion call,
The architect of freedom’s hall,
Was Gandhiji (Bapu) , man tall!
He held the torch of freedom high;
Many freedom fighters did die;
And many people heaved a sigh;
As democracy stood too nigh!
‘Jai Hind! Jai Bharat! ’

C.K. loquitur.
I dreamed I was in fair Niphon.
Amid tea-fields I journeyed on,
Reclined in my jinrikishaw;
Across the rolling plains I saw
The lordly Fusi-yama rise,
His blue cone lost in bluer skies.
At last I bade my bearers stop
Before what seemed a china-shop.
I roused myself and entered in.
A fearful joy, like some sweet sin,
Pierced through my bosom as I gazed,
Entranced, transported, and amazed.
For all the house was but one room,
And in its clear and grateful gloom,
Filled with all odors strange and strong
That to the wondrous East belong,
I saw above, around, below,
A sight to make the warm heart glow,
And leave the eager soul no lack,-
An endless wealth of bric-a-brac.
I saw bronze statues, old and rare,
Fashioned by no mere mortal skill,
With robes that fluttered in the air,
Blown out by Art's eternal will;
And delicate ivory netsukes,
Richer in tone than Cheddar cheese,
Of saints and hermits, cats and dogs,
Grim warriors and ecstatic frogs.
And here and there those wondrous masks,
More living flesh than sandal-wood,
Where the full soul in pleasure basks
And dreams of love, the only good.
The walls were all with pictures hung:
Gay villas bright in rain-washed air,
Trees to whose boughs brown monkeys clung,
Outlineless dabs of fuzzy hair.
And all about the opulent shelves
Littered with porcelain beyond price:
Imari pots arrayed themselves
Beside Ming dishes; grain-of-rice
Vied with the Royal Satsuma,
Proud of its sallow ivory beam;
And Kaga's Thousand Hermits lay
Tranced in some punch-bowl's golden gleam.
Over bronze censers, black with age,
The five-clawed dragons strife engage;
A curled and insolent Dog of Foo
Sniffs at the smoke aspiring through.
In what old days, in what far lands,
What busy brains, what cunning hands,
With what quaint speech, what alien thought,
Strange fellow-men these marvels wrought!
As thus I mused, I was aware
There grew before my eager eyes
A little maid too bright and fair,
Too strangely lovely for surprise.
It seemed the beauty of the place
Had suddenly become concrete,
So full was she of Orient grace,
From her slant eyes and burnished face
Down to her little gold-bronze feet.
She was a girl of old Japan;
Her small hand held a glided fan,
Which scattered fragrance through the room;
Her cheek was rich with pallid bloom,
Her eye was dark with languid fire,
Her red lips breathed a vague desire;
Her teeth, of pearl inviolate,
Sweetly proclaimed her maiden state.
Her garb was stiff with broidered gold
Twined with mysterious fold on fold,
That gave no hint where, hidden well,
Her dainty form might warmly dwell,
A pearl within too large a shell.
So quaint, so short, so lissome, she,
It seemed as if it well might be
Some jocose god, with sportive whirl,
Had taken up a long lithe girl
And tied a graceful knot in her.
I tried to speak, and found, oh, bliss!
I needed no interpreter;
I knew the Japanese for kiss,
I had no other thought but this;
And she, with smile and blush divine,
Kind to my stammering prayer did seem;
My thought was hers, and hers was mine,
In the swift logic of my dream.
My arms clung round her slender waist,
Through gold and silk the form I traced,
And glad as rain that follows drouth,
I kissed and kissed her bright red mouth.
What ailed the girl? No loving sigh
Heaved the round bosom; in her eye
Trembled no tear; from her dear throat
Bubbled a sweet and silvery note
Of girlish laughter, shrill and clear,
That all the statues seemed to hear
The bronzes tinkled laughter fine;
I heard a chuckle argentine
Ring from the silver images;
Even the ivory netsukes
Uttered in every silent pause
Dry, bony laughs from tiny jaws;
The painted monkeys on the wall
Waked up with chatter impudent;
Pottery, porcelain, bronze, and all
Broke out in ghostly merriment,
Faint as rain pattering on dry leaves,
Or cricket's chirp on summer eves.
And suddenly upon my sight
There grew a portent: left and right,
On every side, as if the air
Had taken substance then and there,
In every sort of form and face,
A throng of tourists filled the place.
I saw a Frenchman's sneering shrug;
A German countess, in one hand
A sky-blue string which held a pug,
With the other a fiery face she fanned;
A Yankee with a soft felt hat;
A Coptic priest from Ararat;
An English girl with cheeks of rose;
A Nihilist with Socratic nose;
Paddy from Cork with baggage light
And pockets stuffed with dynamite;
A haughty Southern Readjuster
Wrapped in his pride and linen duster;
Two noisy New York stock-brokérs
And twenty British globe-trottérs.
To my disgust and vast surprise
They turned on me lack-lustre eyes,
And each with dropped and wagging jaw
Burst out into a wild guffaw:
They laughed with huge mouths opened wide;
They roared till each one held his side;
They screamed and writhed with brutal glee,
With fingers rudely stretched to me,-
Till lo! at once the laughter died,
The tourists faded into air;
None but my fair maid lingered there,
Who stood demurely by my side.
"Who were your friends?" I asked the maid,
Taking a tea-cup from its shelf.
"This audience is disclosed," she said,
"Whenever a man makes a fool of himself."

Take this upon thy brow!
And, parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow-
You are not wrong, to deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand-
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep- while I weep!
Oh God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
Oh God! can i now save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?

How neatly a cat sleeps,
sleeps with its paws and its posture,
sleeps with its wicked claws,
and with its unfeeling blood,
sleeps with all the rings-
a series of burnt circles-
which have formed the odd geology
of its sand-colored tail.
I should like to sleep like a cat,
with all the fur of time,
with a tongue rough as flint,
with the dry sex of fire;
and after speaking to no one,
stretch myself over the world,
over roofs and landscapes,
with a passionate desire
to hunt the rats in my dreams.
I have seen how the cat asleep
would undulate, how the night
flowed through it like dark water;
and at times, it was going to fall
or possibly plunge into
the bare deserted snowdrifts.
Sometimes it grew so much in sleep
like a tiger's great-grandfather,
and would leap in the darkness over
rooftops, clouds and volcanoes.
Sleep, sleep cat of the night,
with episcopal ceremony
and your stone-carved moustache.
Take care of all our dreams;
control the obscurity
of our slumbering prowess
with your relentless heart
and the great ruff of your tail.
Translated by Alastair Reid

I opened the door in answer to a knock
And seeing who stood there
Gave me quite a shock
For there stood a fairy
Looking sad and forlorn
Her appearance was dirty
Disheveled and worn
Her shoes were all dusty
Her hair a tangled mess
She had knots in her ribbons
And rips in her dress
Her face was brown smudged
Her lips cracked and dry
Her wings were so tattered
She no doubt could not fly.
I welcomed her in
And we sat down for tea
This bedraggled little sprite
And still in shock me
I asked her to tell me
The tale of her plight
She looked at me sadly
Tears made her eyes bright
As she told me a story
Of swords, lords and knights.
Her beloved handsome Prince
Whom she loved with all breath
Had been wounded lay bleeding
So very near death
Hunched over his body
While shouting to the skies
He grasped her hand tightly
Gazed into her eyes
He managed to whisper
With last dying breath
Please go on without me
In life find the best.
As she finished her story
I awoke with a start
To a knock on my door
And I felt my heart stop
I snuck to the window
And gave out a peek
On the porch stood a unicorn
With an ice cream cone horn...

I know a dream called America -
That led to freedom - our precious -
freedom. That was won - That was won -
through - loneliness - hunger - blood-
Sweat - and tears. By your christian forefathers - who
Fought on with determination - through
The night - and through the day - till
The war was won. In the cold - cold - winter snow of
Seventeen-Seventy-Six - that won us
our freedom. Happy birthday America to everyone
Say a prayer for your country - everyone -
Give a helping hand - everyone - for the
Cause of freedom - everyone - let no one
take your freedom from this land - for
It is our hope - and our passport everyone -

Methought I saw him but I knew him not;
He was so changed from what he used to be,
There was no redness on his woe-worn cheek,
No sunny smile upon his ashy lips,
His hollow wandering eyes looked wild and fierce,
And grief was printed on his marble brow,
And O I thought he clasped his wasted hands,
And raised his haggard eyes to Heaven, and prayed
That he might die -  I had no power to speak,
I thought I was allowed to see him thus;
And yet I might not speak one single word;
I might not even tell him that I lived
And that it might be possible if search were made,
To find out where I was and set me free,
O how I longed to clasp him to my heart,
Or but to hold his trembling hand in mine,
And speak one word of comfort to his mind,
I struggled wildly but it was in vain,
I could not rise from my dark dungeon floor,
And the dear name I vainly strove to speak,
Died in a voiceless whisper on my tongue,
Then I awoke, and lo it was a dream!
A dream? Alas it was reality!
For well I know wherever he may be
He mourns me thus -  O heaven I could bear
My deadly fate with calmness if there were
No kindred hearts to bleed and break for me!
Alexandrina Zenobia

Believe me, this was true last night,
Tho' it is false to-day.
-  A.M.F. Robinson.
A fair dream to my chamber flew:
Such a crowd of folk that stirred,
Jested, fluttered; only you,
You alone of all that band,
Calm and silent, spake no word.
Only once you neared my place,
And your hand one moment's space
Sought the fingers of my hand;
Your eyes flashed to mine; I knew
All was well between us two.
* * * * *
On from dream to dream I past,
But the first sweet vision cast
Mystic radiance o'er the last.
* * * * *
When I woke the pale night lay
Still, expectant of the day;
All about the chamber hung
Tender shade of twilight gloom;
The fair dream hovered round me, clung
To my thought like faint perfume:-
Like sweet odours, such as cling
To the void flask, which erst encloses
Attar of rose; or the pale string
Of amber which has lain with roses.

I am packing to go to the airport
but somehow I am never packed.
I keep remembering more things
I keep forgetting.
Secretly the clock is bolting
forward ten minutes at a click
instead of one. Each time
I look away, it jumps.
Now I remember I have to find
the cats. I have four cats
even when I am asleep.
One is on the bed and I slip
her into the suitcase.
One is under the sofa. I
drag him out. But the tabby
in the suitcase has vanished.
Now my tickets have run away.
Maybe the cat has my tickets.
I can only find one cat.
My purse has gone into hiding.
Now it is time to get packed.
I take the suitcase down.
There is a cat in it but no clothes.
My tickets are floating in the bath
tub full of water. I dry them.
One cat is in my purse
but my wallet has dissolved.
The tickets are still dripping.
I look at the clock as it leaps
forward and see I have missed
my plane. My bed is gone now.
There is one cat the size of a sofa.

Why should I join with those in Play,
In whom I've no delight,
Who curse and swear, but never pray,
Who call ill Names, and fight.
I hate to hear a wanton Song,
Their Words offend my Ears:
I should not dare defile my Tongue
With Language such as theirs.
Away from Fools I'll turn my Eyes,
Nor with the Scoffers go;
I would be walking with the Wise,
That wiser I may grow.
From one rude Boy that's us'd to mock
Ten learn the wicked Jest;
One sickly Sheep infects the Flock,
And poysons all the rest.

1.
We kept war in the kitchen.
A set of ten bone china plates, now eight.
As if a perfumed guest stole her riches . . .
The next day she wanted to leave at noon.
I said, be back by four, I'm paying you.
She sat by the door,
she put out her hand,
her knuckles knocked against mine,
hard deliberate knuckles. I gave her cash.
Off to watch movies, off to smoke ganja.
2.
She came back late and high as if my fear asked for it.
I called her junglee.
Everything went off late --
dinner, the children getting into bed;
but the guests understood:
they had servants too.
She stuck diaper pins in my children.
I cursed her openly.Who shouted?
Or I cursed her silently and went my way.
She stole bangles my husband's mother bought,
bangles a hundred years old.But she wore frayed jewelry
hawked on the street.She was like a rock that nicked
furniture in corners you'd think only a rat could go.
3.
Why didn't I dismiss her?
I don't know.
She got old as I got old.
I could see her sharp shoulder bones
tighten, her knuckled skull.
I had to look at her.It had to wound me.
Listen, said my mother. Yes mother, I listened, crouched in my head.
Looking over the flowered verandah she said:
Who are you to think you are beautiful?
What have you got to show?
Go sit on your rag.
All my life I tended to looks,
they betrayed me. I bore you.
I am wretched.Be my mother.Be my maid.

Evil days.
Jealous eyes.
The world's alive with hateful spies
Sent to see my spirit dies
Because it might be something... wonderful.
Evil days.
Haunted nights.
I feel naught beyond these blights
Upon my soul, my heart, my mind,
Left by people afraid to find
That I might be something... wonderful.
Evil days.
Wicked dreams.
Tears drench my pillow to the seams
That are frayed from pulling, pounding, and pain
That floods my spirit like poison rain
Falling from the lips of sneering foes
Who fear I might be something... wonderful.
Evil days.
Hopeful dawns.
I will arise to face these pawns
Of malicious Fate, that trembling power
That grows more nervous by the hour,
Realizing that I'll not be drowned,
I'll not be burned, I'll not be bound.
His chains can't hold me, his shackles won't hinder.
And though my heart is fragile as tinder
It has ignited with fires invincible.
One day they'll see I'm something... wonderful.

How can you expect me to sit here,
and not say a word?
I want to punch your lights out,
I want to make it hurt.
Do you enjoy making people feel bad?
yes, you make us feel like crap.
Do you get off on hurting others?
Your a stupid friggin' witch.

Good thoughts, 'tis said, are no more than good dreams
Save they be into action put, and that
On opportunity depends. Alas!
If place and power cohered, what good were done
Which else, a babe still-born, has no way here,
But in the womb of good intention fails,
The heart's abortion! Ay, and thuswise too,
Full many a foul intent in that it has
No power or place of action is debarred
A monstrous birth. So nature haply does
In some mysterious way we do not know
Still hold the balance 'tween the good and ill
Of thought in action here, and we become
(In spite of our own selves full oft indeed)
Dispensers of a higher equity
Than the bare law of reason would allow.

If you look for evil good you cannot see
For your eyes only tell you what they want you in others to see
Of good and bad races you keep telling me
But your opinions are different to mine we see things differently.
I've worked with those of different races and backgrounds and in truth I can say
That people as a whole are quite good in their own way
Of different beliefs and cultures but I found them to be okay
If you show respect for others respect to you they will pay.
When you start comparing races you I do not wish to hear
your ignorance on such matters only based on your fear
Of those you see as different to you difference you cannot embrace
'Tis wrong to condemn people because of their race.
If you are only looking for flaws in those who are different to you then flaws you will find
To the good that is in them you do become blind
In this multicultural World your thinking renders you as small
One must admire those who believe in a fair go for all.

a child abused
a gift from god refused,
insanity at its peak,
makes young
and vulnerable weak.
beyond the scene of laughter
a murky cry of torture.
it pains to see,
a child humbled and scared,
with pain in the eyes,
unspoken fear of shame,
and a broken pride.
a gloom of darkness
around him spreads,
afraid to trust and,
mind never at rest,
shadow of torture
tears his being,
all his life
he sees himself dieing.
a childhood thus,
pain imprints in mind,
what ever happened,
to that glorious smile.?
a child
gift of god,
a blessing for parents,
a laughter in the home,
dont lose him,
to the darkness of fate
take care of him,
it is never too late.

This is the sorrowful story
Told when the twilight fails
And the monkeys walk together
Holding their neighbours' tails: --
"Our fathers lived in the forest,
Foolish people were they,
They went down to the cornland
To teach the farmers to play.
"Our fathers frisked in the millet,
Our fathers skipped in the wheat,
Our fathers hung from the branches,
Our fathers danced in the street.
"Then came the terrible farmers,
Nothing of play they knew,
Only. . .they caught our fathers
And set them to labour too!
"Set them to work in the cornland
With ploughs and sickles and flails,
Put them in mud-walled prisons
And -- cut off their beautiful tails!
"Now, we can watch our fathers,
Sullen and bowed and old,
Stooping over the millet,
Sharing the silly mould,
"Driving a foolish furrow,
Mending a muddy yoke,
Sleeping in mud-walled prisons,
Steeping their food in smoke.
"We may not speak to our fathers,
For if the farmers knew
They would come up to the forest
And set us to labour too."
This is the horrible story
Told as the twilight fails
And the monkeys walk together
Holding their kinsmen's tails.

'Twas when the rain fell steady an' the Ark was pitched an' ready,
That Noah got his orders for to take the bastes below;
He dragged them all together by the horn an' hide an' feather,
An' all excipt the Donkey was agreeable to go.
Thin Noah spoke him fairly, thin talked to him sevarely,
An' thin he cursed him squarely to the glory av the Lord: --
"Divil take the ass that bred you, and the greater ass that fed you --
Divil go wid you, ye spalpeen!" an' the Donkey went aboard.
But the wind was always failin', an' 'twas most onaisy sailin',
An' the ladies in the cabin couldn't stand the stable air;
An' the bastes betwuxt the hatches, they tuk an' died in batches,
Till Noah said: -- "There's wan av us that hasn't paid his fare!"
For he heard a flusteration 'mid the bastes av all creation --
The trumpetin' av elephints an' bellowin' av whales;
An' he saw forninst the windy whin he wint to stop the shindy
The Divil wid a stable-fork bedivillin' their tails.
The Divil cursed outrageous, but Noah said umbrageous: --
"To what am I indebted for this tenant-right invasion?"
An' the Divil gave for answer: -- "Evict me if you can, sir,
For I came in wid the Donkey -- on Your Honour's invitation."

Peace fills the air as she rolls on her back
She got through it, She is alive and she thanks Him for that!
It may loom in the mind of her loved ones today
but soon it will vanish all signs of illness will fade.
Don't focus on it...for there is solace in Peace.
There is vision in health and hope moves her feet!
Then when she feels better and she starts to dream...
anticipation will fill her heart and Life will get Sweet.
For in the years to come She will begin to persist...
there will only be Faith and an abundance of Health.
There is happiness in visions that will make her fluid,
that makes her pliable, ready to change and just do it.

I doubt you will read this
I don’t believe this is of any use
I can’t concede this is a worthy verse
I don’t think I could do any worse
I never will be right
When I just can’t see any light
When I am so unclear
When I am far from your love
When I am gripped by fear
I never will be true
If I do not have faith in You.

faith is Nile's flood
setting ground  for grace
faith - it flies in and out
a mother bird divides feed
the blessed a bushel
the others little by little
the almighty plays a game of chess -
-  listens to spiritual  music -
- and hums his heavenly nursery rhyme
that calms terrified earthly souls -
faith is Nile's flood that springs silent cheers from heart to heart
inspired by
'Faith' is a fine invention
When Gentlemen can see—
But Microscopes are prudent
In an Emergency.
Emily Dickinson

We hold our faith
close to our chest
and will never let it go,
after all, it is the way we live our lives,
our judgements and our calls.
The way that we walk,
that makes us tall.
It is our future hope;
we have to get us through,
the disappointments and temptations
that come our way.
(18 September 2007)

you are there
i know
&
you are here now
i very well know with all my eyes closed
my heart now opens
&
doubt is always
behind you
taunting

Have faith! But not to touch it
Not to hold it like I hold this pen-
Just have faith-
Even amidst the treason
Even amidst the doubt
Even in the face of that glaring question
'Does he really exists? '
Have Faith!
Have Faith! Thats the only answer
The end of every discussion over it
Just have faith-
It was never proved and established,
It will never be proved and established
It won't ever become a fact
That is why they say-
Have faith.
Have faith its not a dogma
Live it as a way of life not rituals
Just have faith-
Its a life long struggle to assert it
Its an unquenched thirst to believe in it
Its an unending search of a bodyless soul
Will always remain unsatisfied so-
Have faith!
Have faith but don't renounce for it
Instead endeavor to achieve and-
Just have faith-
That the endeavors will be successful
That they will breed more dreams to chase
That achieving is also a faith
But does not require conquering
Have faith!
Have Faith but not to fight atheism
That again is another face of faith
Just have faith-
To believe that the Ideal exists
To follow the Ideal, not to preach
To emulate the Ideal to the nearest possible
That is the purpose of all faiths
So have faith!

Love & faith go hand in hand
When two hearts connect
and make a stand
There is no distance
that can separate
The man who finds
his perfect mate

In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.
Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone;
But my five wits, nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,
Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be.
Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
That she that makes me sin awards me pain.

The word of faith unto me pardon brings,
Shows me the ground and reason whence it springs:
To wit, free grace, which moved God to give
His Son to die and bleed, that I might live
This word doth also loudly preach to me,
Though I a miserable sinner be,
Yet in this Son of God I stand complete,
Whose righteousness is without all deceit;
'Tis that which God himself delighteth in,
And that by which all his have saved been.

At Christmas families,
gather around a family Christmas tree
to open gifts of love
each has left there for one another.
The tree sparkles
with lights and coloured tinsel,
while on top there sits an angel
to watch over everyone.
Carefully wrapped presents adorn the floor
around the bottom of the tree.
Each has been wrapped
and sealed with a loving kiss,
one for you and one for me.
Then on Christmas morn
as the dawn breaks the sky
the children climb out of their bed
and tiptoe downstairs to the presents,
getting ready to explore.
Before the day is over
there will be shrills of laughter
and joy ringing out
at all they have received
from beneath a family Christmas tree.

The mother gone
The father mad
The brothers crying
The sister's numb
Not feeling
But knowing
The change is coming
Bracing herself
No help anymore
From anyone

At home
Husband
And wife...
Some time fighting...
Word's to words...
With bad words...
Sometime hit
The husband wife
Mistakes...
Wife was crying...
Husband was woory...
Wife also
Lovingely hit...
Husband also take easy...
At night husband
Wanted wife
For sex...
Wife will say
Backpain acting
Going for
Hear with life
Every day
At familylife...!

Can't live with them
and, I 'can'
Live without them,
Family what's it good for
Fighting, shouting, screaming.
Love, what's that?
Family and Love
Impossible
Your not my Sister!
Your not my Brother!
So what family we talking about
Family tree? What's that?
is it like Love?

Your mouth is biger then
the world is round
someone tells you something
and you run home and tell
my dad
he and you both make me feel
like i dont belong
in this world
you tell him things
that i never said or did
you say things to me
and when i tell him
you deny everything
you are family so i
have to love you
RIGHT?
well i do just
most of the time
i dont feel i have
A reason to love you

New born
and strawberry blond!
Your tiny head
thatched like your father's
(used to be, before the grey)
and I said,
'She takes after her father'
(proudly)
But  later,
your hair hidden in a hat,
you gaze calmly at me
with my own ironic expression
and I can see
my mother
and her mother
looking back at me
and I'm proud
and glad
of that.
........................................ ............................................

Being born into a big family
in the midst of uncertainties,
Real understanding
and perseverance it carries.
All sorts of human thoughts
and emotions set into focus,
Towards realigning own family solidarity
despite wide disparity
On the basis of practicality
loyalty and sincerity.
Families produced though varied in sizes
and unevenly shared  rapport,
Act on the instinct of love
respect and moral support.
Men and women alike are one
in times of a true call,
Inspiring each member to be strong
and to stand tall.
Life could be rough and tough
yet not one must quit,
Yield only to the family
and never to others outside it.

With open arms
They welcomed me
With open arms
They let me stay
With open hearts
They loved me
With open hearts
They show they cared
With open minds
They listend to me
With open minds
they believed me
Its very hard to find people
People that care
So hard infact
I think it's rare

O flower at my window
Why blossom you so fair,
With your green and purple cup
Upturned to sun and air?
'I bloom, blithesome Bessie,
To cheer your childish heart;
The world is full of labor,
And this shall be my part.'
Whirl, busy wheel, faster,
Spin, little thread, spin;
The sun shines fair without,
And we are gay within.
O robin in the tree-top,
With sunshine on your breast,
Why brood you so patiently
Above your hidden nest?
'I brood, blithesome Bessie,
And sing my humble song,
That the world may have more music
From my little ones erelong.'
Whirl, busy wheel, faster,
Spin, little thread, spin;
The sun shines fair without,
And we are gay within.
O balmy wind of summer,
O silver-singing brook,
Why rustle through the branches?
Why shimmer in your nook?
'I flutter, blithesome Bessie,
Like a blessing far and wide;
I scatter bloom and verdue
Where'er my footsteps glide.'
Whirl, busy wheel, faster,
Spin, little thread, spin;
The sun shines fair without,
And we are gay within.
O brook and breeze and blossom,
And robin on the tree,
You make a joy of duty,
A pride of industry;
Teach me to work as blithely,
With a willing hand and heart:
The world is full of labor,
And I must do my part.
Whirl, busy wheel, faster,
Spin, little thread, spin;
The sun shines fair without,
And we are gay within.

Father you are always on my mind, I love you Father and trust
in you with all my heart.  I have no questions  for your decisions,
my faith is strong and true.
Father I’m in awe when I look around this world, when I stand
and take in the awesome views, I know this is the work of the
Master, and that Master for certain is you.
This morning Father I pray for those without faith, who can not
see pass their noses.  They have eyes that function, but they
truly can not see.
Father give these blind people the ability to come out from their
deadened shells, touch them with your spirit, let them see the
light.
Oh Father God, drench them with your love so they make no
mistake.  Take them by the hand so some day they too will
walk through Heaven’s Gate.
Father sometime young people are taken in  by those who have
no interest in their soul but only in the money that they hold.
The devil’s people live among us, taking advantage of many.
Your children need  your guidance Father and your continued
patience for I truly  believe some day they will come out of the
darkness, walk into the light and face the truth.
Father I leave these people to you, in your caring hands.  May
they make Jesus the center of their lives and join their brothers
and sisters who know the  truth, save them Father.
I Love you Father and I ask this Lord in the name of your only
Son Jesus.-Amen

"Are you deaf, Father William!" the young man said,
"Did you hear what I told you just now?
"Excuse me for shouting! Don't waggle your head

You're standing in the doorway.
Your workday is all done.
He waits to see you everyday,
this boy that is your son.
He hopes you will go fishing.
He hopes you'll shoot the gun.
He just wants to be with you,
this boy that is your son.
He is your spitting image.
To him you are ''The One''.
He hopes to be just like you,
this boy that is your son.
You show him what a man is.
You teach as you have fun.
You are admired as well as loved
by this boy that is your son.
You've got a friend forever.
Until the world is done.
Then, still you will be holding
this man that is your son.

Father of love, to thee I bend
My heart, and lift mine eyes;
O let my pray'r and praise ascend
As odours to the skies.
Thy pard'ning voice I come to hear,
To know thee as thou art:
Thy ministers can reach the ear,
But thou must touch the heart.
O stamp me in thy heav'nly mould,
And grant thy word appl'd
May bring forth fruit an hundred fold
And speak me justify'd.

I feel sorry to myself that …..
I have no memory of playing with you as my father
I did not have a chance to feel your hug... your love as my father;
It’s so tragic that I can’t even remember
How you look like… how you were as my father
When my friends talking about their fathers
It’s so sad that I have nothing to share about you
I know your full name,
But I don’t know who you are as a man… as my father;
Father.....who are you?

During the war, I was in China.
Every night we blew the world to hell.
The sky was purple and yellow
like his favorite shirt.
I was in India once
on the Ganges in a tourist boat.
There were soldiers,
some women with parasols.
A dead body floated  by
going in the opposite direction.
My son likes this story
and requests it each year at Thanksgiving.
When he was twelve,
there was an accident.
He almost went blind.
For three weeks he lay in the hospital,
his eyes bandaged.
He did not like visitors,
but if they came
he'd silently hold their hand as they talked.
Small attentions
are all he requires.
Tell him you never saw anyone
so adept
at parallel parking.
Still, your life will not be easy.
Just look in the drawer where he keeps his socks.
Nothing matches.  And what's the turtle shell
doing there, or the map of the moon,
or the surgeon's plastic model of a take-apart heart?
You must understand --
he doesn't see the world clearly.
Once he screamed, "The woods are on fire!"
when it was only a blue cloud of insects
lifting from the trees.
But he's a good boy.
He likes to kiss
and be kissed.
I remember mornings
he would wake me, stroking my whiskers
and kissing my hand.
He'll tell you -- and it's true --
he prefers the green of your eyes
to all the green life
of heaven and earth.
Anonymous submission.

The memory of my father is wrapped up in
white paper, like sandwiches taken for a day at work.
Just as a magician takes towers and rabbits
out of his hat, he drew love from his small body,
and the rivers of his hands
overflowed with good deeds.

To Mr Lawrence
Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son,
Now that the fields are dank, and ways are mire,
Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire
Help waste a sullen day, what may be won
From the hard season gaining? Time will run
On smoother, till Favonius re-inspire
The frozen earth, and clothe in fresh attire
The lily and rose, that neither sowed nor spun.
What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice,
Of Attic taste, with wine, whence we may rise
To hear the lute well touched, or artful voice
Warble immortal notes and Tuscan air?
He who of those delights can judge, and spare
To interpose them oft, is not unwise.

This man
who is not
my father
is
my
father.
The other’s laugh:
“It’s not your turn but
he calls only for you! ”
And so I go
& clean him up
his skeleton thin body
splashed with urine & sh**.
I laugh & joke
with him.
He chuckles
as I tell him:
“Michael...you used to be
so full of crap
but sh**...now you’re not! ”
Lucky
our Irish sense of humour
extends this far
say anything with love and
it becomes so.
It is a tired old joke
but like a child he
pounces on its nuances
relishing each pause and stupid syllable!
I bathe
him
this man
who is not my father
gently as if he were
my child.
I sing
to him
all the old songs
I learned
at my father’s hands
as he bathed me.
“...why does my poor heart keep following you...”
We sing together
softly as I bathe him
dress him
anew
in the memory
of my father.
This man
who is not
my father
becomes
my father
as my hands learn
to care for him.
I settle
a pillow
behind
his head
wipe sweat
from his forehead
stroke
his hair
until  his sleep
is full
of dreams

A darting fear—a pomp—a tear—
A waking on a morn
To find that what one waked for,
Inhales the different dawn.

When life becomes a trembling world of fear,
you question every single move you make,
afraid your loving soul will disappear;
for danger looms, awaiting your mistake.
What hidden word will cause explosion's might
to back you in a corner of despair?
Your sole reprieve lies in the ebon night,
yet anger boils from pain he wouldn't spare.
Where love once dwelled resides a burning hate
as desperation's hand has gained control.
No longer viewed as your eternal mate;
to save yourself becomes the utmost goal.
Envisioning a pool of crimson red;
a knife within your hand; your fear is shed.

Fear haunts the eyes, of the terrified young
Slaughter replacing, days once filled with fun
Streets full of laughter, now places of dread
Market squares littered, with the dying and dead
Tiny hands clenching, coats tattered and torn
Relying on mothers, to keep them from harm
Cordite and dust, still thick in the air
Stinging their eyes, now filled with despair
Truely an age of innocence passed
Drawing on breath, which may be their last
Brought into a world, full of violence and hate
What kind of impression, do we hope to create
The youth of today has ourfuture on hold
Bitter and twisted, we created the mould
No love or affection, just the will to deprive
How can we as a race, ever hope to survive.

Fear of failure has failed me again!
I’ve hit rock bottom so many times
that it has become my second home.
I can’t find what I’m looking for...
because I don’t where to even look.
Loneliness stood by me for so long,
but now even that abandons me!
Now all I have left is emptiness!

I stand on the shore line,
the tide washes between my toes.
I stare at the horizon before me
in a dream-like state.
I should have been prepared.
My mother once said life is more
than you want it to be.
When the sky transforms into
a water color painting,
the water washes between my knees.
My eyes fixed on the horizon.
I knew it was coming,
but I was blinded by fear
and couldn't acknowledge it.
The moon replaces the
sun in the night sky.
The water rises to my neck.
I inform Hell, I am coming.
I shut my eyes as the salty water
rises over them.
I notice my fear has won again.
I open my eyes,
to watch the brightness of stars,
darkened by the depth of the water.
At the bottom, there is no Hell
but life.

I know how father's strap would feel,
If ever I were caught,
So mother's jam I did not steal,
Though theft was in my thought.
Then turned fourteen and full of pitch,
Of love I was afraid,
And did not dare to dally with
Our pretty parlour maid.
And so it is and always was,
The path of rectitude
I've followed all my life because
The Parson said I should.
The dread of hell-fire held me straight
When I was wont to stray,
And though my guts I often hate,
I walk the narrow way.
I might have been a bandit or
A Casanovish blade,
But always I have prospered for
I've always been afraid;
Ay, fear's behind the best of us
And schools us for success,
And that is why I'm virtuous,
And happy - more or less.
So let me hail that mighty power
That goads me to be good,
And makes me cannily to cower
Amid foolhardihood;
Though I be criminal in gain,
My virtue a veneer,
I thank the God who keeps me sane,
And shields me from distress and pain,
And thrifts me on to golden gain,
Almighty Fear.

The stream is shrunk--the pool is dry,
And we be comrades, thou and I;
With fevered jowl and dusty flank
Each jostling each along the bank;
And, by one drouthy fear made still,
Forgoing thought of quest or kill.
Now 'neath his dam the fawn may see,
The lean Pack-Wolf as cowed as he,
And the tall buck, unflinching, note
The fangs that tore his father's throat.
The pools are shrunk--
the streams are dry,
And we be playmates, thou and I,
Till yonder cloud--Good Hunting!--Loose
The rain that breaks our Water Truce.

Do you want to know,
What I fear the most?
It isn’t a vampire,
Nor a ghost.
For the werewolf's claw,
I do not hide,
The banshee and I,
Walk side by side.
I chat with the witch,
About cook recipes,
Not even the monsters,
I do despise.
No only one thing,
Do fear with a passion,
No, it’s not girls,
Who’re too into fashion.
I fear for to be lonely,
Without family and friends,
If they were all gone,
The my life would end.

In the empty field, in the morning,
the body waits to be claimed.
The spirit sits beside it, on a small rock--
nothing comes to give it form again.
Think of the body's loneliness.
At night pacing the sheared field,
its shadow buckled tightly around.
Such a long journey.
And already the remote, trembling lights of the village
not pausing for it as they scan the rows.
How far away they seem,
the wooden doors, the bread and milk
laid like weights on the table.

The man was sentenced to death
jury was agreed and the magistrate already signed.
He was an innocent criminal and a scapegoat
but no options.
The true criminal with the Lords
and the Law is imbalanced.
One night in the prison cell
he saw a fire-fly like an ambulance
and he scribbled on the wall.
'Tomorrow morning a prince comes
to take me away, a better world,
my little fire-fly you try to show me the way
and I see that real world from your faint light.
Thank you so much my dear
now only I realized that I was in the total darkness
beneath the sun and moon.'
Welcome to our world my dear friend Denis.Joe

Slowly I smoke and hug my knee,
The while a witless masquerade
Of things that only children see
Floats in a mist of light and shade:
They pass, a flimsy cavalcade,
And with a weak, remindful glow,
The falling embers break and fade,
As one by one the phantoms go.
Then, with a melancholy glee
To think where once my fancy strayed,
I muse on what the years may be
Whose coming tales are all unsaid,
Till tongs and shovel, snugly laid
Within their shadowed niches, grow
By grim degrees to pick and spade,
As one by one the phantoms go.
But then, what though the mystic Three
Around me ply their merry trade? --
And Charon soon may carry me
Across the gloomy Stygian glade? --
Be up, my soul! nor be afraid
Of what some unborn year may show;
But mind your human debts are paid,
As one by one the phantoms go.
ENVOY
Life is the game that must be played:
This truth at least, good friend, we know;
So live and laugh, nor be dismayed
As one by one the phantoms go.

I see pain in their eyes.
I hear sorrow in their cries.
Inside I break and cry alone,
with my eyes of fire and heart of stone.
No matter how much pain I feel
I am sure that I will always deal
the way I know..alone
with my eyes of fire and heart of stone.
Others may not know the fear.
They know just what they see or hear.
I come off cruel and cold.
Inside I'm not...I'm just not bold.
I have to thank my mother
for the love she's never shown
The one thing that she did give me...
her eyes of fire and heart of stone.

Fire, I am fire
In this summer
I am your digestion
Fire, I am fire
I join with air
My indoor and
Outdoor game
Is in truth and fair.

A Searing Flame
It Hides My Shame
The Pain It Melts Away
An Orange Glow
Softens The Blow
Of Memories Deep Inside
The Warmth And Light
Pirce The Night
And Drive Away My Fear
The Defening Roar
Heals The Sore
Of Pain Once Pushed Away

some money I was desperately needing
gambling debts paid or I'd soon be bleeding
my bar was already deep in the red
'youse got insurance? ', the mob guy said
'dis dump you could combust
but get an alibi - dat is a must'
Hmm.. 'arsonist' ain't in the phone book -
so around my bar, I took a look
found some hot-headed guy with a thing for crime
but he couldn't start anything on time
He smelled like gas, dressed like a slob
Was always smoking on the job
he demanded up front, all of his cash
then sat around on his ash
always had his face in a cup
his work ethic just burned me up
five nights now with no ignite
I was smoldering mad, it just wasn't right
I finally had to re-cinder the deal
he wasn't a match for the job, I feel

Fire:
When the water turns to mist
And the flames are rising high
I'll appear to you my darling
To wipe the tears from your eyes
I'll dance around the fire pit
Running wild with the flames
But as soon as the fire is out
I'll leave you without so much as my name
Water:
When water extinguishes the flame
It will also extinguish me
I will leave you to yourself
To soak in memory
When the land is watered down
And you stand beside the sea
Look for the bonfires
For that is where you'll find me
Burned:
Don't play with fire dearest
You know you will be burned
Leave the flames to me my love
They remind me of how I've yearned
For the sensation of my fire
That keeps our passions hot
I'll stay with you until the tide comes in
But after, I cannot
Drowned:
They douse the flames with water
Putting out the light
I drown with the flames
That ensnared you all night
I cannot stay with you now
My flames have been drowned out
But remember whenever you need me
Fire will bring me about

the fire,
i love it,
the way it dances,
out of control leaping,
into the air it's,
so beautiful,
the way it dances,
the way the sparks,
fly up high and,
the flame shows me,
the past,
the future,
and what might have been,
the cracking of a,
new twig in the fire,
the jumping,
the dancing,
the leaping,
the uncontrollable flame,
when it dies,
so does my spirit.

naked flame, you're dancing higher
tasting life with such desire
but time passes, now to bed
of soft black ashes, pillows red
remembers knowing, it's admired
in embers glowing, now attired

Her closed eyes whispered to me
In that Cajun French accent
She had perfected; as her
Rose petal lips wet my appetite,
I devoured her each and every delicious breath.
My appetite, not to be denied
Was thirsty for more and more
“Baby, I’ve seen it all before” she said,
As I untied her halter and released
Her perfect breasts to my blind me
Of my prowess….

Everything depends on food
Be cool and cool and take
Suitable food conducive to
The practice of meditation
Reflection spiritual inquiry.

Food clothing and shelter
bare necessities.
But not all.
Peace and harmony in society
is necessary
But it does not suffice.
The world is one
And we must be friendly
And we must move
positively.

She hid it
but it became clear to her
even as a child
she was obsessed with food-
all the world and her relationships in it-
became things to be tasted;
consumed.
In her twenties she did not date men
she tasted them
and became bored
with them as one becomes
bored with the routine
of every day the same meal;
food was orgasmic to her
in its variety
but too,
this was  something she had to hide
because being that way also
had its guilty side;
all day long
she thought about what she would eat
that night
and the next day
or even reliving
a last  meal
re-tasting it in her mouth
it all seemed natural to her
because it seemed to her
others seemed to share as well
foods power.
It was a need to take
the outside in
to feel it in her mouth
swallow it down
tongue on texture
then a final act
of it resting inside her
as she digested it,
sometimes bulimically
to assuage  guilt
it being hidden heavings
in bathrooms, hers and those
of her friends
but always returning
to the need to fill up the Empty
to feel full
filled
to make it through some nights
eating
to assuage grief
sometimes to celebrate
often late at night secret eating
munching, ingesting
taking in
gorging on
cake and ice cream
chocolate
and potato chips
even beer
or liqueur
with exotic
items like mangos
and papayas
all carefully laid out before her
because she liked the ritual of it
the handing
the smells
the preparations and the cooking;
fork and spoon lifting high
to the altar of her mouth
to her wide lips
resting briefly upon her fiery tongue
to the savoring
the plunging onward
into the alimentary canal
to its final
warm resting place
inside.
And then the guilt
always the guilt
about what she had done
then on to the next day obsession about her  weight
the battle of the bulge
of the unwanted thickening sure to come
of the terrifying knowledge
her eating at night
it would show up
decorating her waist line
her hips,
her thighs
crime and punishment come alive
visible for all to see.
She reveled in her pregnancy
eating herself
to 51 additional pounds
and not losing all of them back
despite furious exercise;
ultimately welcoming mother hood
because cooking for her kids kept her in touch
with food
and after all
no mother
was expected to be thin;
and then escalator down
she gradually gave up
food had won
and she knew
that with advancing age
she could not lose back the years.
In despair, kids and husband now gone
she decided that it was not the food she'd been carving
all those years
rather it was a feeling of being filled up
being loved
food was just a poor substitute
And dear reader you ask what then?
She fell in love with a younger man
half her age
and he reciprocated.
the excitement of his loving her
made her feel for the first time in years
love
and gradually over a year
she lost the need for food
as a crutch.
More and more it became
for her a thing past.
Oh she did not  suddenly become a size two
but she did become a better her
more energy
and she needed that energy
becoming more and more thrilled
with whom she then was.
And yes, the two did last;
food not so much exiled
as becoming for her
only a once over-indulged
repast
from her past.

I have been chasing that truck,
For 2kms, now and I will be dead
For the morsel the world cannot reach me,
Or the gods that cant make in my soil.
Why do these guys fight madly,
Brother to brother, friend to friend,
I and my type of folks live and die,
For the the beliefs and wrath
They carry, billions on arms are
Here to fight, but not a grain
To swallow, the land has become
Waterless and  dry, even the rivers
have flown away, as if scared of
Human madness, Oh food, food
When will you appear for our hungry
Souls, which sure will go to heavens,
Since our penance are over forever,
And our sins have beeen wahed away
For all the humanity by our hunngry stomachs.

'Every person who smokes, is going to die.
Every person who never smokes, is going to die.
Every person who is 'overweight', is going to die.
Every person who is never overweigh, is going to die.
Every person who drinks alcohol, is going to die.
Every person who never drinks alcohol, is going to die.
Every person who fails to heed the advice of health advocates, is going to die.
Every person who devotedly follows all the advice of health advocates, is going to die.
Death is inevitable.
Doctors are powerless to stop it.
Yes, it's a fact.within the next 120 years, every person alive in the world today will have died.
6 billion people will die.
There is nothing that medical science can do about it.
Doctors are not Gods, despite what they may think.
They will not, they cannot conquer death.
Universe is a big RECYCLE MACHINE.'
And you small human being who really will know that you were here?
After three generations you will be deleted from human memories.
Who will know that you have passed from the earth?
Time is the killer of all the memories
And the natur is your killer.
Don't try to understand. Try to give love and share.
Life is always bitter sweet get only what gives to you.
If you want more you will never be happy.
Your life is the beginning from your end.
Nature does not recognize you as personality,
You are a piece of the puzzle of life.
You are not all the puzzle.
Your mission is just to give life and food to eternity.
And the eternity is the reason that you exist.

I want some food
True
I do not want food
From anybody
Also true.
I know this mind
Is a product of food
I eat
I want food
Cooked by a person
Of pure heart
I know man is
What he eats.
I want some food.

I had a peanut butter sandwich today
which made me think of all the way....
sssss my life has been touched by that
stick-to-your-mouth sludge of peanut fat.
Not 'touched' in the sense that it's shaped my life,
but  when I open a jar and take up a knife
or a spoon, I can picture times of enjoy-
ment as an adult consumer and as a boy.
Of course I'm lucky in that I generally enjoy food
even if I'm in a rare bad mood.
I assume pb was a common snack in my childhood,
though I'm not sure it was.  My memory is not that good.
But I do remember my Mom made cookies from it;
I helped her.  And the first cooled cookie I'm sure I bit,
paying some attention to the crisscross pattern on top,
or the sometimes-present big chocolate drop.
And when I visited my childhood neighbor, Helen, it's a good bet
that  sometimes a  peanut butter sandwich I would get.
[But I really better remember that Helen's kitchen at times had cake.
I assume her mother, Betty, the cake did make.]
At Halloween there were pb 'cups' made by Reeses.
Chocolate and pb.  It's good they were small pieces!
As an adult pb has been with me off and on.
Probably when I shared a home with my brother Don,
and when Shannon, my daughter, was young (that makes me smile) ,
and when I lived in a storage garage for a short while.
I used to put it on plain warm toast, but
perhaps mixed-with-vanilla-ice cream I enjoyed it most.
I can't tell you how it would taste on sliced tomato,
but I can say it wasn't good when tried on mashed potato! !
And as I type today there's an unsealed jar nearby.
My wife cautions me against too much, but I'm not sure why.
From time to time it's a treat on cereal or bread,
but usually it's just a spoon of it I stick into my head.

In food is a certain quality of taste,
May they abstain and be erased.
For food manages my godly life,
Just as the fish manage with strife.
In this food, in that food we collapse
And honour a feast with some gaps.
The food we eat as dinner shall be kind
To the sleep we carry throughout the mind.
What food do you cook with expertise?
Fish and meat will certainly cease!

I still remember those childhood days,
We could not go where the big brother plays,
But we had our tiny little niche,
Around the balconies, where maids wash the dish,
Round the year was our football season,
Much cheaper than cricket was the reason,
Did not have the boots to play with,
Bare-foot or pain was no reason to quit,
We did have our own competition,
Apart from fun and the strenuous lessons,
World cup was too far, had no knowledge,
Affluent always had over us an edge,
86’ was the first world cup I watched,
WOW the number of goals than Maradona notched,
But this time Chennaites may not be as lucky,
CAS for signal carrier has made our fate shaky.
CAS: Is Conditional Access System for the Pay Channels, which many households do not have.

Case in point proven. I told you that we the patriots will win the Superbowl of World Peace, but the sell of the Patriots winning the football game ''this year'' was the falsehood. Again I say, ''Selling falsehood doesn't stop truth from happening.'' - Joshua Aaron Guillory

I loved to play football,
That night I dreamt that
I was tirelessly running and running with the ball
To score a goal,
But in spite of my utmost effort,
I failed to score it again and again,
Finally when I succeeded to score the spectacular goal,
I found that I had already lost the match,
All my efforts were in vain.

Twenty-two fierce beasts
Strive to control one small ball
Move from end to end
Flesh and bone meets bone and flesh
At the end, one beats the other.

Low on the ground, low, low, low.
Then in more than a language will
The meaning of the verse light.
And then the heavens will light –
And after reign of Night at Dawn.

Don't hand, foul or

Around his bed his friends and family but of them he's not aware
His life's journey about to end old Joe the ex footballer player
On his back his eyes closed to his surroundings the life from him ebbing away
Last month he celebrated his eightieth birthday and today his life's final day.
Pre-deceased by his wife Mel she died five years ago
The last two years of his life's journey for him painful and slow
Most of those he played with and against in his football years to the Reaper long gone
But like the battler that he is to the end he's battling on.
Fifty five years ago the Captain of the great Premiership team
By football fans from near and far he was held in high esteem
But time takes care of everyone and everyone means all
And time has also taken toll of the champion of football.
Around his bed his friends and family a silent vigil keep
The end of his life's journey no more than an hour away he is in his final sleep
'Tis a fact those who love life do find it hard to die
But 'tis also a fact that all human beings are mortals and facts do never lie.

I've often found it quite baffling
People’s immense love for a sport
That’s nothing more than ball handling
And a thunderous crowd of rare support.
Male and female, old and young
The spirit takes over their hearts and souls
Holding them captive, and quite overhung
Until the scoring of the goals.
Have you noticed the deserted streets
On a day a match is to be played?
Have you observed the loud drumbeats
That accompanies a team-win parade?
I ask myself, is this love or is this obsession?
Is this fan sell-out without discretion?
That a ball-engage in a ninety minute session
Would elicit from so many, such weighty expression.
Football binds the country, they're quick to say
Football is an antidote for dismay
Whether to watch or whether to play
Football reigns every day.
At this point, there’s nothing more that I can say
Other than pass the ball, and let us play
Football it is any day
Football it is all the way.

The shots fired out
The scared soldier dashed back to the fort
He had witnessed enough
He had only went to 'experience' war
And now he wanted to go home desperately
He had made friends, lifelong they were
Good people
Then came the battles
The first six didn't take any of his best friends, only people he knew
But that last one took Charlie
Charlie was his most treasured friend
But Charlie was slowly dying
A painful death
Back at the lines was Charlie
Lying helpless in a pool of blood
Surrounded by bodies
That were badly mangled as his
The new soldier had a choice
To take refuge at the fort
Where most of the 'bravest' men had escaped to
Or risk his life for his new friend
The young man died that day
'Cry Freedom, ' he declared boldly
As he rushed to the lines
The shots fired out
And the man was thrown to his friend's side on the ground
''Thanks, man, ' said the dying friend
'I knew you would come'
Those brave men died
Fighting for our country
For our families today
Cry freedom in America
For more will die
If we keep fighting
So help with the war
Cry freedom

Freedom to love again.
Freedom to try love again without thinking
about the past.
Freedom to think without worry.
Freedom to dance  to my
new found love..
Freedom to feel the touch of another man
heart and soul.
Freedom to forget the past.
Freedom to cry without any sorrow......
Freedom to walk with out trials and
trubulations...
Freedom to be along and think
in peace.
Freedom to start a new life feel with love
again...
Thank you for freedom......................

It is spoken man is born equal and free
To a degree the world disagrees
Some foresee what others cannot see
Freedom is walking away with glee
We have a right to Christmas with a tree
We have a right to enjoy a shopping spree
We have a right to travel the land and the sea
We have the right to an educational degree
Stop the silly talking
Whilst Freedom is walking
Freedom is not a jubilee
Freedom is not a guarantee
Who says Freedom is free?
It is spoken man is free of thought
Without the need to fear higher courts
Some have spoken and finally resorted
To hide their thoughts from being reported
We have a right to a chosen culture
We have a right not to be tortured
We have a right to nationality and security
We have a right to be part of a minority
Stop the silly talking
Whilst Freedom is walking
Freedom is not part of community
Freedom is never an informality
Who says Freedom is immunity?
We want opinion without distinction
We want a world without discrimination
We want a kingdom of utter freedom
We want it in all shapes and form
Stop the silly talking
Whilst Freedom is walking
Stop the silly talking
Whilst Freedom is mocking

To speak how I feel
But how is it freedom
To be judged for my deeds
And persecuted for speaking
Revealing my thoughts
How is it freedom
To fear being called strange
To think different thoughts
To the people you call friends
I live in my mind
I hide in my brain
I don't dare to speak out again
And I'm free to be lonely
And misunderstood
I'm free to be hated and shunned
This is the freedom
This is not freedom
It cannot be freedom
To hide from the world

What is freedom? Nobody knows.
What do I think is freedom?
Freedom is,
when you can do what you like
Without ever hurting somebody
Freedom is,
when you are healthy,
Not trammelled in your bed
Freedom is,
when you are in free charge of your time
And not dominated by a watch
Freedom is,
when you can say what you think
As long as it doesn’t hurt somebody else
Freedom is,
when you can make a mistake
Without getting immediately punished for it
Freedom is,
when you can go and get milk
Whenever you want some
Freedom is,
The one thing we all want to have,
The one thing that none of us really has,
The one thing each of us defines different,
The one thing we will never have………
Freedom is…………a dream

So many people around me.
The ones I love and the ones I hate.
I have the freedom.
I have the freedom to love.
I have the freedome to hate.
The freedom to care.
The freedom to concern
The freedom to worry
The freedom to be hurt
The freedom to be sad
The freedom to be happy
The freedom to say what i want to say.
All of these freedoms i have.
All of these feelings i have.
You could do anything with your freedom.
Let the chains break.
Spread your wings
And fly away.
Don't let anyone get you down.
Make sure you use your freedoms correctly
You use your feelings and freedoms to make friends and the right choices.
Understand your freedoms and feelings.
We have the freedom to do what our hearts yearn to do.

Soldier, Soldier, cries the child
My father is a freedom fighter
He is fighting for me and my family
He is giving his life for his home land
The sun rises and falls on him
Our enemies have fallen in numbers as dawn comes
We will be free form our enemies
We will have much to celebrate soon
We don't eat even in the hour of noon
The reason? that our hearts are with father
We will be like him when we grow up
Our land will be at the top
We will earn respect form the on lookers
And as a child, I cry for other fathers

To have the right to dream
and to follow it each day
until some tiny part of it
is you in every way
gives zest to all of living
and lets you dream some more
'til at last you are near heaven's gate
as your thoughts lift up and soar.
This, then, the freedom that I seek
for you and all mankind
the spark of real achievement
capturing heart and soul and mind.
To strike off lingering chains of doubt
look out on a new day
where freedom holds you to a task
that asks your best in every way.

How many noble schemes from goodwill's heart,
how many splendid plans and fine ideas
have foundered, lost their glorious craft and art
through hesitancy born of baseless fears?
We do not see the moment as divine,
thinking that those plans are somehow 'ours';
forgetting, too,  that Providence sublime
yields timeless good through time in human hours:
the task begun, this heavenly Providence
begins to move; bestows her love's support
with means, events, beyond coincidence;
assistance past all dreams of human thought -
be bold! and trust in Providence above:
she brings to earth God's magic; power; and love.

Two friends went to a forest.
One was very much honest,
And the other one was very bad,
Daily, for their livelihood.
One day, they saw a wild bear,
Almost coming close, very near.
The bad man climbed a nearby tree,
But the other one couldn't reach the tree.
He lied below the tree, posing as dead,
As he knew well, bears touch not any dead.
Without moving his limbs, he held his breath.
The bear smelt his body lying in close to death.
After it went away without harming him,
The man from the tree asked him,
What the bear whispered into his ears,
When he remained with closed eyes?
'The bear told me not to trust such
Selfish friends like you, very much,
And also said that a friend in need,
Is really a friend in deed.'

A true friend is always there for you
A true friend will help you no matter ther problem
A true friend is like a sister, she knows your better, than you know yourself
A true friend is someone who knows when you're sad, ans can cheer you up when you need it most
A true friend is someone that can make you laugh no matter what they say or do
A true friend is someone who believes in you
A true friend will stick by your side
A true friend is someone you can call just if you need a shoulder to lean on
But most of all a true friend will never leave you

Art thou abroad on this stormy night
on thy journey of love, my friend?
The sky groans like one in despair.
I have no sleep tonight.
Ever and again I open my door and look out on
the darkness, my friend!
I can see nothing before me.
I wonder where lies thy path!
By what dim shore of the ink-black river,
by what far edge of the frowning forest,
through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading
thy course to come to me, my friend?

In measured verse I'll now rehearse
The charms of lovely Anna:
And, first, her mind is unconfined
Like any vast savannah.
Ontario's lake may fitly speak
Her fancy's ample bound:
Its circuit may, on strict survey
Five hundred miles be found.
Her wit descends on foes and friends
Like famed Niagara's fall;
And travellers gaze in wild amaze,
And listen, one and all.
Her judgment sound, thick, black, profound,
Like transatlantic groves,
Dispenses aid, and friendly shade
To all that in it roves.
If thus her mind to be defined
America exhausts,
And all that's grand in that great land
In similes it costs --
Oh how can I her person try
To image and portray?
How paint the face, the form how trace,
In which those virtues lay?
Another world must be unfurled,
Another language known,
Ere tongue or sound can publish round
Her charms of flesh and bone.

Art thou abroad on this stormy night
on thy journey of love, my friend?
The sky groans like one in despair.
I have no sleep tonight.
Ever and again I open my door and look out on
the darkness, my friend!
I can see nothing before me.
I wonder where lies thy path!
By what dim shore of the ink-black river,
by what far edge of the frowning forest,
through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading
thy course to come to me, my friend?

Your words, my friend, (right healthful caustics) blame
My young mind marr'd, whom Love doth windlass so,
That mine own writings like bad servants show
My wits, quick in vain thoughts, in virtue lame;
That Plato I read for nought, but if he tame
Such doltish gyres; that to my birth I owe
Nobler desires, lest else that friendly foe,
Great Expectation, were a train of shame.
For since mad March great promise made of me,
If now the May of my years much decline,
What can be hoped my harvest time will be?
Sure you say well, "Your wisdom's golden mine,
Dig deep with learning's spade." Now tell me this,
Hath this world aught so fair as Stella is?

Today, because I couldn't find the shortcut through,
I had to walk this town's entire inner
perimeter to find
where the medieval walls break open
in an eighteenth century
arch. The yellow valley flickered on and off
through cracks and the gaps
for guns. Bruna is teaching me
to cut a pattern.
Saturdays we buy the cloth.
She takes it in her hands
like a good idea, feeling
for texture, grain, the built-in
limits. It's only as an afterthought she asks
and do you think it's beautiful?
Her measuring tapes hang down, corn-blond and endless,
from her neck.
When I look at her
I think Rapunzel,
how one could climb that measuring,
that love. But I was saying,
I wandered all along the street that hugs the walls,
a needle floating
on its cloth. Once
I shut my eyes and felt my way
along the stone. Outside
is the cashcrop, sunflowers, as far as one can see. Listen,
the wind rattles in them,
a loose worship
seeking an object,
an interruption. Sara,
the walls are beautiful. They block the view.
And it feels rich to be
inside their grasp.
When Bruna finishes her dress
it is the shape of what has come
to rescue her. She puts it on.

Sir,
Our times are much degenerate from those
Which your sweet muse with your fair fortune chose,
And as complexions alter with the climes,
Our wits have drawn the infection of our times.
That candid age no other way could tell
To be ingenious, but by speaking well.
Who best could praise had then the greatest praise,
'Twas more esteemed to give than bear the bays:
Modest ambition studied only then
To honour not herself but worthy men.
These virtues now are banished out of town,
Our Civil Wars have lost the civic crown.
He highest builds, who with most art destroys,
And against others' fame his own employs.
I see the envious caterpillar sit
On the fair blossom of each growing wit.
The air's already tainted with the swarms
Of insects which against you rise in arms:
Word-peckers, paper-rats, book-scorpions,
Of wit corrupted, the unfashioned sons.
The barbèd censurers begin to look
Like the grim consistory on thy book;
And on each line cast a reforming eye,
Severer than the young presbytery.
Till when in vain they have thee all perused,
You shall, for being faultless, be accused.
Some reading your Lucasta will allege
You wronged in her the House's privelege.
Some that you under sequestration are,
And one the book prohibits, because Kent
Their first petition by the author sent.
But when the beauteous ladies came to know
That their dear Lovelace was endangered so:
Lovelace that thawed the most congealèd breast --
He who loved best and them defended best,
Whose hand so rudely grasps the steely brand,
Whose hand most gently melts the lady's hand --
They all in mutiny though yet undressed
Sallied, and would in his defence contest.
And one, the loveliest that was yet e'er seen,
Thinking that I too of the rout had been,
Mine eyes invaded with a female spite,
(She knew what pain 'twould cause to lose that sight.)
`O no, mistake not,' I replied, `for I
In your defence, or in his cause, would die.'
But he, secure of glory and of time,
Above their envy, or mine aid, doth climb.
Him valiant'st men and fairest nymphs approve;
His book in them finds judgement, with you love.

You smile upon your friend to-day,
To-day his ills are over;
You hearken to the lover's say,
And happy is the lover.
'Tis late to hearken, late to smile,
But better late than never;
I shall have lived a little while
Before I die for ever.

I walked in to the marshes sad
And spotted him there on the lilly pad
He sat there, so very tiny
With slippery feet that were way too slimy
I'd slipped into a place I wasn't fond
And occupied myself with this little pond
I pulled up my long, tattered sleeves
And engaged with this fellow looking at me
Then I decided, I'd kiss him on the head
And he'd turn into a handsome prince instead!
I took his wet body, put his head to my lips
And kissed him there, what a trip!
Frightened, he started to ribbit up a storm
As I waited for him to transform
And then I concluded, alone in that bog
I had been fooled into kissing a...frog! ?

F-reely living liking animal eats harmful insects in farmers' land
R-uns, jumps, swims in the water of lake, canal, pond;
O-bnoxious humans are but great threat to it
G-aining black money they are trafficking it.

Every frog must croak
That is no joke
Agile is the lowly frog
Eating insects, leaving bugs, mosquitoes agog
They live in water, slime, gook
Ugly, ugly face of a spook
Green, gray or brown, they populate the ground
Frog legs are sold and eaten by the pound
Jump, glide around, sit still
Croak often, loud and shrill
Water is the key to their life
They procreate, sleep, avoid danger, strife
Little or big they struggle to survive
Even a frog is happy to be alive
Some become road kill
Or a snake's belly they fill
They have lived, they have died
Some rot, some are fried
Dissected in the lab by a sharp knife
Warts and all, a vital link in the chain of life

Moonlit night and
A moonlit pond, a frog riddled
with emotions

Man prides himself with intelligence
Human Logic rationalizing,
But what he really lacks is Patience
When the moment requires some waiting.
Today a frog in blithe expertise,
Had some short lessons laid in action.
He showed that trying should never cease,
For Success comes with Repetition.
He jumped on a green stalk, missing twice.
Then returned to make good his attempt.
Jumped once more, no defeat in his eyes -
He missed, but held the end of the hemp.
He climbed one leg up, still holding on,
His frog face tinged the trace of a smile,
His other arm grasped at victory won -
Sat on top of the leaf in a while!

The frog proclaims unabashedly
Within hearing of everyone
He brags that he has paid his dues
And did it even before the last hour,
Paid much more than what was worth
Every bit of what was owed and more
So, he held his head up high
Nothing else matters now
The day is a mockery for him,
Beneath an imagined sun,
Basking in delight in a shrouded glow
Owning the dark of night,
The cold of the puddle,
An empty inheritance in creased parchment,
He now croaks his incessant boast
In a pond where day refuses to come

There once was a frog,
Who sat on a log,
And didn't know what to do.
He looked around,
Sat on the ground,
Then saw the birds flying above.
The birds were high,
High in the sky,
And looked like they wouldn't come down.
The frog watched and stared,
Then got scared,
Then he ran off into to town.

a frog
who is never given the pond
that he deserves
cannot appreciate
what beauty is,
and the white crane
whose beauty you
adore
who takes frogs
for dinner
of course
shall never be
his goddess

I can see that
water frog
In a pond

WITH steady march across the daisy meadow,
And by the churchyard wall we go;
But leave behind, beneath the linden shadow,
One, who no more will rise and go:
Farewell, our brother, here sleeping in dust,
Till thou shalt wake again, wake with the just.
Along the street where neighbor nods to neighbor,
Along the busy street we throng,
Once more to laugh, to live and love and labor,--
But he will be remembered long:
Sleep well, our brother, though sleeping in dust:
Shalt thou not rise again--rise with the just?
Farewell, true heart and kindly hand, left lying
Where wave the linden branches calm;
'T is his to live, and ours to wait for dying,
We win, while he has won, the palm;
Farewell, our brother! But one day, we trust,
Call--he will answer Thee, God of the just.

The time has not come before
And this is new.
The light is opening for the day
An ingénue displaying her bosom
To man’s face-
I remember when
I was young in following her.
Her tassels feeling through the trees
And drinking roots,
She laughed even while
Alone;
Giggling,
She rode her bicycle across campus.
I staid up all night and prayed for her.
When tired, she slept
In the shade of a house-
Eyes half closed. I came to her,
She yawned and turned me away.
She said she loved me
Only when she was drunk,
And it was yet that time-
So long ago, yesterday....
Then early this morning she came to me
And offered me the quaff
Of lips.
Dripping nectar on the limbs,
She said, “Never before now, old man, ”
As they lowered me in the grave,
Her light budded
A valleyide of rubrum,
A wedding at my funeral.

A day to say I am sorry
A day to say I love you
A day filled with unending feelings
A day filled with chocked emotions
Yielding myself to showers of tears
The shortness of life yields to death
Not allowing us to gauge every friendship
Not allowing us to give thanks for the memories
Giving us to retain
The Mythical
The magical
Thought of all this
But can I feel solemnity
A voice screams
Tribute Tribute
Inside of me
The screaming battles
With the burning devils from hell
Cannot be heard
Pacify me and cool my thoughts
With your comfort
The place where you will go
Absence of conflict and strife
The sun will shine again
Leaving behind the black and white
Vivid colors of an intangible arch
Stemming from the last down pour of tears
A distant rainbow belonging to you
Begging me to run through
Fickle threads catching
Raining colors of your love
From your absence
Voids, hollowness, and distressed wounds
Are being stitched shut
Smoothing healing balm
Covers like a blanket
Keeping you alive within me forever.

The death, end of the life journey
But not the end itself
The joining of self to the universe
The place of oblivion we can't explain.
The body after death, a corpse
To be cremated in such an honor
The self, soul and their activities
For which the body functioned hitherto.
A funeral pyre we makes
For its destruction on bodily matters
The final destiny it follows
Where it becomes flames and ashes.
Funeral in varied customs and beliefs
Changes of methods and things are one
The final journey must be in calm
without a return and repetition of the same.
Honor the death, the will of god
Your actions and life events are reckoned
And matters to the humans
Let the final journey come when it destines.
In a calm and perfect time like a ripe leaf.
.

Bright day of autumn, springing
Morning dews thin out, how pleasant it
Is to make last journey…….

Night funeral
In Harlem:
Where did they get
Them two fine cars?
Insurance man, he did not pay--
His insurance lapsed the other day--
Yet they got a satin box
for his head to lay.
Night funeral
In Harlem:
Who was it sent
That wreath of flowers?
Them flowers came
from that poor boy's friends--
They'll want flowers, too,
When they meet their ends.
Night funeral
in Harlem:
Who preached that
Black boy to his grave?
Old preacher man
Preached that boy away--
Charged Five Dollars
His girl friend had to pay.
Night funeral
In Harlem:
When it was all over
And the lid shut on his head
and the organ had done played
and the last prayers been said
and six pallbearers
Carried him out for dead
And off down Lenox Avenue
That long black hearse done sped,
The street light
At his corner
Shined just like a tear--
That boy that they was mournin'
Was so dear, so dear
To them folks that brought the flowers,
To that girl who paid the preacher man--
It was all their tears that made
That poor boy's
Funeral grand.
Night funeral
In Harlem.

A GLORIOUS voice hath ceased!-
Mournfully, reverently-the funeral chant
Breathe reverently! There is a dreamy sound,
A hollow murmur of the dying year,
In the deep woods. Let it be wild and sad!
A more Aeolian melancholy tone
Than ever wail'd o'er bright things perishing!
For that is passing from the darken'd land,
Which the green summer will not bring us back-
Though all her songs return. The funeral chant
Breathe reverently!-They bear the mighty forth,
The kingly ruler in the realms of mind-
They bear him through the household paths, the groves,
Where every tree had music of its own
To his quick ear of knowledge taught by love-
And he is silent!-Past the living stream
They bear him now; the stream, whose kindly voice
On alien shores his true heart burn'd to hear-
And he is silent! O'er the heathery hills,
Which his own soul had mantled with a light
Richer than autumn's purple, now they move-
And he is silent!-he, whose flexile lips
Were but unseal'd, and lo! a thousand forms,
From every pastoral glen and fern-clad height,
In glowing life upsprang:-Vassal and chief,
Rider and steed, with shout and bugle-peal,
Fast rushing through the brightly troubled air,
Like the wild huntsman's band. And still they live,
To those fair scenes imperishably bound,
And, from the mountain mist still flashing by,
Startle the wanderer who hath listen'd there
To the seer's voice: phantoms of colour'd thought,
Surviving him who raised.-O eloquence!
O power, whose breathings thus could wake the dead!
Who shall wake thee? lord of the buried past!
And art thou there-to those dim nations join'd,
Thy subject-host so long?-The wand is dropp'd
The bright lamp broken, which the gifted hand
Touch'd, and the genii came!-Sing reverently
The funeral chant!-The mighty is borne home-
And who shall be his mourners?-Youth and age,
For each hath felt his magic-love and grief,
For he hath communed with the heart of each:
Yes-the free spirit of humanity
May join the august procession, for to him
Its mysteries have been tributary things,
And all its accents known:-from field or wave,
Never was conqueror on his battle bier,
By the vail'd banner and the muffled drum,
And the proud drooping of the crested head,
More nobly follow'd home.-The last abode,
The voiceless dwelling of the bard is reach'd:
A still majestic spot: girt solemnly
With all the imploring beauty of decay;
A stately couch 'midst ruins! meet for him
With his bright fame to rest in, as a king
Of other days, laid lonely with his sword
Beneath his head. Sing reverently the chant
Over the honour'd grave!-the grave!-oh, say
Rather the shrine!-An alter for the love,
The light, soft pilgrim steps, the votive wreaths
Of years unborn-a place where leaf and flower,
By that which dies not of the sovereign dead,
Shall be made holy things-where every weed
Shall have its portion of the inspiring gift
From buried glory breathed. And now, what strain,
Making victorious melody ascend
High above sorrow's dirge, befits the tomb
Where he that sway'd the nations thus is laid-
The crown'd of men?
A lowly, lowly, song.
Lowly and solemn be
Thy children's cry to Thee,
Father divine!
A hymn of suppliant breath,
Owning that life and death
Alike are Thine!
A spirit on its way,
Sceptred the earth to sway,
From Thee was sent:
Now call'st Thou back Thine own-
Hence is that radiance flown-
To earth but lent.
Watching in breathless awe,
The bright head bow'd we saw,
Beneath Thy hand!
Fill'd by one hope, one fear,
Now o'er a brother's bier,
Weeping we stand.
How hath he pass'd!-the lord
Of each deep bosom chord,
To meet Thy sight,
Unmantled and alone,
On Thy bless'd mercy thrown,
O Infinite!
So, from his harvest home,
Must the tired peasant come;
So, in one trust,
Leader and king must yield
The naked soul, reveal'd
To Thee, All Just!
The sword of many of a fight-
What then shall be its might?
The lofty lay,
That rush'd on eagle wing-
What shall its memory bring?
What hope, what stay?
O Father! in that hour,
When earth all succouring power
Shall disavow;
When spear, and shield, and crown,
In faintness are cast down-
Sustain us, Thou!
By Him who bow'd to take
The death-cup for our sake,
The thorn, the rod;
From whom the last dismay
Was not to pass away-
Aid us, O God!
Tremblers beside the grave,
We call on thee to save.
Father divine!
Hear, hear our suppliant breath,
Keep us, in life and death,
Thine, only Thine!

The funeral procession drove past my house
I bowed my head and I was quite as a mouse,
In a solemn prayer I gave to the sadly departed
As I knew of the sadness and remorse of the fainthearted;
One car after another I watched go down the street
As I still stood there in respect in this unbearable heat,
The cars that I counted they were over twenty-five
Sadly not one visited the departed when he was still alive;
So, there goes his procession heading to the graveyard
As though being led by weepers and the national guard,
I guess when he was living his life he was always misread
Now he is missed and remembered since now he is dead.

sitting alone with nowhere to go
ignoring the static from the radio
that interrupts my favorite song
haven’t loved it in so long
some say love is a foolish thing
and although not in all cases
i can’t help but agree
with the smarter majority
so many weddings
just white funerals
a hand to hold
for the rest of her life
open to the bliss
and the carelessness
be careful, more careful
does it still feel right
i’ll apologize in all the places
where i frowned at all the smiling faces
i just wonder if that will be me
with a wedding dress and a history
so much thought in an august moment
i’m living in my favorite season
but winter’s here, and taking control
as we let the rest of our days unfold
so many weddings
just white funerals
someone she barely knows
becomes her life
open to neglect
and disrespect
that comes with the one
she loved last night
i think of someone i know
better than anyone
i think i’ll be more optomistic
when this is done
can’t help but to think
that my white funeral
won’t be a funeral at all
because i know him
she doesn’t know him
so many weddings
just white funerals
but i’m so glad
that won’t be mine
open to his
fuffilled promises
he knows who i am
we’ll be fine
the white funeral is over
the bride’s been burried
in her own mistake

Welcome to the Colosseum
Where pain is pleasure and it is our pleasure to be of service
Lay back on the rack
The waxing poetics are hot and the iced humor is very dry
The fence sitter splinters are sharp but the elitist tongues are sharper
There are many painful pleasures which abound
We guarantee your total satisfaction
Or we'll give you fifty lashes of your back for free
For no one ever enters with a smile
Who doesn't leave here with a grimace
(2007)

it's funny how hello is always accompanied with goodbye
it's funny how good memories can start to make you cry
it's funny how forever never seems to last
it's funny how much you'd lose if you forgot about your past
it's funny how “friends” can just leave when you are down
it's funny how when you need someone they never are around
it's funny how people change and think they're so much better
it's funny how many lies are packed into one “love letter”
it's funny how one night can contain so much regret
it's funny how you can forgive but not forget
it's funny how ironic life turns out to be
but the funniest part of all, is none of thats funny to me

Seems everyone just hates to see me change
But my brain feels maimed with no ambition of fame
Just money and its funny all I want is that and my honey
Coz the rest are all dummies and I can’t get chummy
With new people who are feeble, fake, and evil
And old friends who crossed me are no longer equals
So i'm use to standing alone prone to breaking thrones
A war zone is my home and a battling I shall go
No love for my peers not after all these years
I won’t shed a tear to hear u all lost what is dear
Coz u haven’t got a clue on what it means to be true
All u do is front, your lost in an image that isn’t you
Like your all a heard of sheep, your all the same no one is unique
U will never reach the peak with all that rubbish you speak
A petty lil criminal running his mouth like he hard is so pitiful
Taking advice from a prisoner? U idiot that’s why u minimal
Wise up learn from the quiet ones before your freedom is critical

When you are in love
And you get abit older
You wish you were forever young
When you are shy
And you get abit bolder
You wish you were forever young
Like the rainbows that follow the rain
My love for you will always be the same
When we both get old and think of love
We wish we were forever young.

I had a funny dream,
about a marshmallow ball...
he made me so giggley,
then my skin started to crawl...
that cute little puff,
of sugar and sweet,
was very soon,
a scary little treat..
he grew and he grew,
out popped feet and hands,
and then i woke up crying,
after being eaten by the marshmallow man.....
: '(
im now officially petrified of marshmallows...

You broke my heart
So many times
Was he sweeter?
Is he better?
Was the grass greener?
On the other side?
Wipe your eyes
Please don't cry
You meet a monster
Clever like Dracula
Please don't bother me
I am eating lobster
With my brother
I hate your sorry lines
And the stupid lies
Get another guy
My love bye, bye
Shut the door
I need time to recover
Sorry it's over

It is not only funny
But very astonishing and clumsy
We all know about the holiness of boobs
Holy mention too can be found in books
Women are much more praiseworthy
Some may wear the ugliness gifted from almighty
The deformity and unnatural growth is not in our hands
The body as such will be submerged and  melted at the end
All nourishment and food is catered from that part
Our life gets shape and growth from the very start
Let us adore and praise the ladies for commendable job
We should not denigrate their honor and rob
It may be shown as world record
Many may take it as mere reference for looking forward
Any good looking natural piece deserves to be praised
But wrong way of projection should also be outrightly condemned
It must be taken as deformity in body
It is not done for records by somebody
It is really annoying for its wrong way of presentation
Otherwise it is not even worth for its mention
The opinion and perception may vary
The impression and meaning may also differently carry
Yet the basic concept of giving honor to ladies need not be compromised
Ladies deserve good comments and treatment as consciously promised

When olive branch, we show the world,
They think, our weakened stage has come,
And treat us worse than ev’n before!
When flag of truce, in hand we hold,
They stiffen conditions on us,
As though we can’t fight anymore!
When bow we as mark of respect,
They look down upon us askance,
As though we are worthless on earth!
The world today is suspicious;
The human lives are less precious;
There’s dearth of people more pious!
Man wants to do whatev’r he likes;
Money decides the things he does;
The love in families seems gone.
One wants to make a quicker buck;
One takes more risks and tries his luck;
One feels things can be got by pluck.
Oh, what a funny world, it seems!
The human face appears well-masked;
The heart of man is ne’er contrite!

A future time, a future place
Here on Earth or out in space
The doors are open if you choose
To learn the skills that you can use
Computers you use every day
Atomic medicine is here to stay
A walk on the moon is a thing of the past
We're on our way to the stars at long last
Radar, and laser, and quasar, and such,
These words sound strange, but they mean so much
Learn these things, and many more
See what wonders the world has in store
Don't let folly lead you away
From Learning the skills you need so today
Have fun in your life, but don't learn with sorrow
That the fun of today won't feed you tomorrow
Be good to yourself, and study with zest,
And, soon, you will find you're ahead of the rest
A future time, a future place
Here on Earth or out in space
The doors are open, come on through
Learn the skills, it's up to you

Aim is my aim,
need is my tomorrow,
want is my future,
All I need is where my future would stand,
future is my aim,
My aim would be my future.

I remember when
love was a stranger
in a lonely life I led,
then you came along,
and my world changed
for the better.
You put sunshine into my smile,
air under my shoes,
made me feel ten foot tall,
and filled with love this empty shell.
Now love walks with me,
everywhere that I go.
The lonely life I lead is no more.
You are my soul and inspiration
as into the future we go.

today i cry myself to sleep
tomorrow i still just weep
next week, my spiral still goes down
feeling like a big clown
not knowing where i'll end up...
i panic, trying to save money but,
losing it to too many bills
next month, will i be over the hill?
or living in my car?
or working at the Nevada bar?
it scares me to think about it
i dont like my life one bit
wishing i'd be hit by a truck
but i dont have such good luck
today i cry myself to sleep
tomorrow is still just weep
next week my sprial still goes down.
Next month...it scares me not to know.

I am the past.
I ask the questions.
Your mission:
imagine the answers
that are true
for only you,
and the world
which you have
created.

As mountains dwell in timeless sleep, as seasons come and go
As oceans roll across the deep, as forests slowly grow
An evil has been gathering, a dark age has begun
All life on earth shall rue this day, the time of man has come
With axe and pick that chop and chip, the land shall be stripped bare
With fire and steel, that burn and deal a death to all who care
With hate and greed, that fuel and feed the coming of the end
Into a fate consumed with hate our world will now descend
As mountains wake, roar and quake, as seasons loose their sway
As oceans rise to turn the tide, and forests die away
A giant is awakening, a cleansing will ensue
All life on earth shall rue this day; the debt of man is due
With rock and flame that smash and maim, life shall be erased
With flood and wave, that drowns and paves a path to deaths embrace
Mother earth begins again, but none remain to tell
That the balance is precarious, between paradise and hell

Give me back my broken night
my mirrored room, my secret life
it's lonely here,
there's no one left to torture
Give me absolute control
over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby,
that's an order!

The bombs have caused death and destruction and the families mourn their dead
But there is hope for the future for better days ahead
When those for peace and World harmony will finally prevail
For those who talk of waging war are surely doomed to fail.
There is hope for the future though I may not live to see my dream
Of a better life for everyone in a World where peace will reign supreme
A World free of borders and camps for refugees
Where the smell of death and destruction is not blowing in the breeze
There is hope for the future around me not all dark
I hear young children playing in the playground in the park
The children are the future and they may well unite
Behind a peaceful leader who won't lead by power of might.
There is hope for the future and all surely not lost
Though there won't be peace tomorrow and 'twill come at a great cost
The Rose of Peace will bloom again though with the dead I lay
And the young and enlightened leaders to peace will lead the way.

We must wait for the future to see
Which is the land, which is the sea?
We must wait for the time to decide
Who are the slaves, who are the free?
We must wait for the future to see
Is the world ours, is the world thee?
We must wait for the future to see
Is the man peaceful, is the mind free?
We must wait for the future to see
I love you? Do you love me?
You will be mine I will be thee
I can dream it, I can see

A girl sang a song in the temple's chorus,
About men, tired in alien lands,
About the ships that left native shores,
And all who forgot their joy to the end.
Thus sang her clean voice, and flew up to the highness,
And sunbeams shined on her shoulder's white --
And everyone saw and heard from the darkness
The white and airy gown, singing in the light.
And all of them were sure, that joy would burst out:
The ships have arrived at their beach,
The people, in the land of the aliens tired,
Regaining their bearing, are happy and reach.
And sweet was her voice and the sun's beams around....
And only, by Caesar's Gates -- high on the vault,
The baby, versed into mysteries, mourned,
Because none of them will be ever returned.

Dark eyes accented by black hair,
she is an Asian girl
that happens to be
one of the most beautiful females
that has ever been seen by these eyes
It took two steps for my heart to explode.

One day,
Dogs will laugh
In the streets,
And we’ll kiss wildly
Like lunatics
Escaping the asylum.
You’re a dark girl
So I’m painting
My roses black,
And I’ll murder the sun
If he ever turns his back.
I would rather
Enter the palace of your pain
Than continue to exist
In the prison cell of my loneliness.

Girl, why don't you dry those tears
You have so much to live for
Things will not always be like this
There is so much more in store
I know that your boyfriend has did you wrong
He has torn your poor heart in two
Sometimes you feel so unsure of yourself
And you just don't know what to do
Just pick your heart up from off the floor
And start again
Many other guys want to get that chance to meet you
There are other fish in the ocean
It really hurts to suffer
Nothing but grief and sorrow
Keep your head up and smile
For there will always be tomorrow

You subjected her to a night of hell
Hey! Did you know?
She was just a little girl
You took her to a run down motel
Hey! Did you know?
She was just a little girl
Now you hold her crying soul to sell
Hey! Did you know?
She was just a little girl
When you forced her out of her shell
Hey! Did you know?
She was just a little girl
Couldn’t you tell by her face?
She had the smile of an angel
A virgin waiting for wedding bells
Hey! Did you know?
You are not well?
The only place you belong is a cell
With horrifying smells!
Hey! Did you know?
She is no more a little girl, they yell

Sparrow, the special delight of my girl,
whom often she teases and holds on her lap
and pokes with the tip of her finger, provoking
counterattacks with your mordant beak,
whenever my luminous love desires
something or other, innocuous fun,
a bit of escape, I suppose, from her pain,
a moment of peace from her turbulent passion,
I wish I could play like she does with you
and lighten the cares of my sorrowful soul.
It thrills me as much as the nimble girl
in the story was thrilled by the gilded apple
that finally uncinched her virginal gown.

She is free of the trap and the paddle,
The portage and the trail,
But something behind her savage life
Shines like a fragile veil.
Her dreams are undiscovered,
Shadows trouble her breast,
When the time for resting cometh
Then least is she at rest.
Oft in the morns of winter,
When she visits the rabbit snares,
An appearance floats in the crystal air
Beyond the balsam firs.
Oft in the summer mornings
When she strips the nets of fish,
The smell of the dripping net-twine
Gives to her heart a wish.
But she cannot learn the meaning
Of the shadows in her soul,
The lights that break and gather,
The clouds that part and roll,
The reek of rock-built cities,
Where her fathers dwelt of yore,
The gleam of loch and shealing,
The mist on the moor,
Frail traces of kindred kindness,
Of feud by hill and strand,
The heritage of an age-long life
In a legendary land.
She wakes in the stifling wigwam,
Where the air is heavy and wild,
She fears for something or nothing
With the heart of a frightened child.
She sees the stars turn slowly
Past the tangle of the poles,
Through the smoke of the dying embers,
Like the eyes of dead souls.
Her heart is shaken with longing
For the strange, still years,
For what she knows and knows not,
For the wells of ancient tears.
A voice calls from the rapids,
Deep, careless and free,
A voice that is larger than her life
Or than her death shall be.
She covers her face with her blanket,
Her fierce soul hates her breath,
As it cries with a sudden passion
For life or death.

I'm looking for a girl who's right for me,
One who knows how to talk intelligently,
She'll laugh at all my jokes,
And ignore the other blokes,
And find that I am just her cup of tea.
The task is not so easy, I have found,
There aren't that many 'right' ones still around,
But if they're out there somewhere,
And if any of them might care,
To find me, then I won't be going to ground.
My charisma can be in itself impressive,
My conversation I know is quite expressive,
I am kind in word and deed,
And I think you will concede,
That I wouldn't be someone who'd be repressive.
I can say that I'm a very balanced chap,
Who, when the going's tough would never flap,
But I'm really keen to find,
A lady of like mind,
Who in fact could quite ideally fill the gap.
So I'm hoping that this lady turns up soon,
Perhaps it could be this very afternoon,
I would greet her with a smile,
Which would certainly beguile,
And my vibrant personality should make her swoon.
So, do you think, that I could really have a chance,
Do you think that she would give me just one glance,
If this 'Miss Right' doesn't show,
That would really be a blow,
And put an end to all my thoughts of true romance.
No, there's got to be a girl who's right for me,
I won't believe there isn't, so soon you'll see,
An attractive lady on my arm,
A lady with such charm,
That eventually we'd become a Royal 'We'.

Vermeer's little girl, now famous
watches me. A pearl watches me.
The lips of Vermeer's little girl
are red, moist, and shining.
Oh Vermeer's little girl, oh pearl,
blue turban: you are all light
and I am made of shadow.
Light looks down on shadow
with forbearance, perhaps pity.

“There, but for the grace of God, goes…”
There is a question that I ask,
And ask again:
What hunger was half-hidden by the mask
That he wore then?
There was a word for me to say
That I said not;
And in the past there was another day
That I forgot:
A dreary, cold, unwholesome day,
Racked overhead,—
As if the world were turning the wrong way,
And the sun dead:
A day that comes back well enough
Now he is gone.
What then? Has memory no other stuff
To seize upon?
Wherever he may wander now
In his despair,
Would he be more contented in the slough
If all were there?
And yet he brought a kind of light
Into the room;
And when he left, a tinge of something bright
Survived the gloom.
Why will he not be where he is,
And not with me?
The hours that are my life are mine, not his,—
Or used to be.
What numerous imps invisible
Has he at hand,
Far-flying and forlorn as what they tell
At his command?
What hold of weirdness or of worth
Can he possess,
That he may speak from anywhere on earth
His loneliness?
Shall I be caught and held again
In the old net?—
He brought a sorry sunbeam with him then,
But it beams yet.

I towered far, and lo! I stood within
The presence of the Lord Most High,
Sent thither by the sons of earth, to win
Some answer to their cry.
--"The Earth, say'st thou? The Human race?
By Me created? Sad its lot?
Nay: I have no remembrance of such place:
Such world I fashioned not." -
--"O Lord, forgive me when I say
Thou spak'st the word, and mad'st it all." -
"The Earth of men--let me bethink me . . . Yea!
I dimly do recall
"Some tiny sphere I built long back
(Mid millions of such shapes of mine)
So named . . . It perished, surely--not a wrack
Remaining, or a sign?
"It lost my interest from the first,
My aims therefor succeeding ill;
Haply it died of doing as it durst?" -
"Lord, it existeth still." -
"Dark, then, its life! For not a cry
Of aught it bears do I now hear;
Of its own act the threads were snapt whereby
Its plaints had reached mine ear.
"It used to ask for gifts of good,
Till came its severance self-entailed,
When sudden silence on that side ensued,
And has till now prevailed.
"All other orbs have kept in touch;
Their voicings reach me speedily:
Thy people took upon them overmuch
In sundering them from me!
"And it is strange--though sad enough -
Earth's race should think that one whose call
Frames, daily, shining spheres of flawless stuff
Must heed their tainted ball! . . .
"But say'st thou 'tis by pangs distraught,
And strife, and silent suffering? -
Deep grieved am I that injury should be wrought
Even on so poor a thing!
"Thou should'st have learnt that Not to Mend
For Me could mean but Not to Know:
Hence, Messengers! and straightway put an end
To what men undergo." . . .
Homing at dawn, I thought to see
One of the Messengers standing by.
- Oh, childish thought! . . . Yet oft it comes to me
When trouble hovers nigh.

God of mercy, God of grace,
Show the brightness of Thy face:
Shine upon us, Saviour, shine,
Fill Thy church with light Divine;
And Thy saving health extend,
Unto earth's remotest end.
Let Thy people praise Thee, Lord;
Be by all that live adored;
Let the nations shout and sing,
Glory to their Saviour King;
At Thy feet their tributes pay,
And Thy holy will obey.
Let the people praise Thee, Lord;
Earth shall then her fruits afford;
God to man His blessing give,
Man to God devoted live;
All below, and all above,
One in joy, and light, and love.

Ye thirsty for God, To Jesus give ear,
And take, through his blood, A power to draw near;
His kind invitation Ye sinners embrace,
Accepting salvation, Salvation by grace.
Sent down from above, Who governs the skies,
In vehement love To sinners he cries,
Drink into my Spirit, Who happy would be,
And all things inherit By coming to me.
O Saviour of all, Thy word we believe!
And come at thy call, Thy grace to receive;
The blessing is given Wherever thou art.
The earnest of heaven Is love in the heart.
To us at thy feet The Comforter give,
Who gasp to admit Thy Spirit, and live;
The weakest believers Acknowledge for thine,
And fill us with rivers Of water divine.

My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
And I have my eyes fixed on him today
While I am walking to school
Because God is coming towards me
To greet me
And there is something going on with my mind
But I don't know what my mind is trying to tell me
Or if God is coming to give me a message
Or to walk with me to school
And to make sure that I am safe while I walk to school
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
He forgives everyone that sins here at home
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
He lives inside of my heart everyday
Because I made room for God inside of my heart
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
He will let the sun shine here at home every single day
And I look forward to the sun every single day
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
My God is an awesome God
Because he is the maker of heaven and earth

People of the living God,
I have sought the world around;
Paths of sin and sorrow trod,
Peace and comfort nowhere found:
Now to you my spirit turns—
Turns a fugitive unblest;
Brethren, where your altar burns,
Oh, receive me into rest.
Lonely I no longer roam
Like the cloud, the wind, the wave;
Where you dwell shall be my home,
Where you die shall be my grave;
Mine the God Whom you adore;
Your Redeemer shall be mine;
Earth can fill my soul no more—
Every idol I resign.
Tell me not of gain and loss,
Ease, enjoyment, pomp, and pow’r;
Welcome poverty and cross,
Shame reproach, affliction’s hour.
“Follow Me”—I know Thy voice;
Jesus, Lord, Thy steps I see;
Now I take Thy yoke by choice,
Light Thy burden now to me.

Blest is the man who spreads the Word of God
To people who have never heard of it!
He serves like an instrument of the lord
And salvages some souls meant for the ‘Pit’.
Blest is the man who quotes the Scriptures well
And interprets them rightly for God’s cause!
He saves some sinners heading to sure hell
And brings more souls to Heaven with less loss.
Blest is the man who guides people to Light!
Rescuing them from Eternal darkness;
He knows the way to Heaven by foresight,
And delivers men from devil’s harness.
Blest is the man of God who spreads gospels!
For, Holy Spirit speaks through him and tells.

The man's name was Jesus of Nazareth
The crime committed read: King of the Jews
While on that cross, He taught Psalm Twenty Two
Then He said, ‘It is finished, ' ending death
He paid the ransom required you know
The Lamb who would be led to the slaughter
Bearing our sins and stripes at His Altar
He is the One written of long ago
The greatest love our God has for His wife
What a great price He paid to set us free
John Three Sixteen: if we belief in Thee
Thou shall give our souls everlasting life
For those who decide to walk in His Way
They shall be grafted to His Tree today
Abiding in Him, inheriting all
For He has not changed, but fulfilled the Law
Through His Word and Spirit we learn all
In His resurrection we see the eternal

Tho thou art Worship'd by the Names Divine
Of Jesus & Jehovah thou art still
The Son of Morn in weary Nights decline
The lost Travellers Dream under the Hill

Congratulation!
Your new pride and elation:
Your new MSW.
You aim higher sky
In your education line
PhD in Psych.
Congratulation!
Your new job with new title
Wellspan Philhaven.
Congratulation!
I wish you the best of all
And best days to come.

To my assistant Patricia Wright MSW
On her graduation day from Millersville University 2017.

C-ommencement program
J-ust starts to confer degrees,
B-estowing honors.

Graduation day
Today is our graduation
And we are leaving all our friends
But this is just a start for us
For a journey that never ends
We will miss our pre-school
And all our teachers too
Who always made such a fuss!
To mold, to love and to educate us

A gentleman or so he seemed
A graduation present was his need
From me my cherry was his goal
Given his way he would have stole
That which is precious for me to save
Until my special wedding day
He kissed and asked, and I said no
He reached, he touched, and I said no
He pushed and grabbed, and I said no
He tried to force and I said no
He didn't stop and I said no
Then with my knee I did said NO
Now he is hurt and I should go
So all his cloths I gathered fast
Through the window they did pass
And past his friends must go his ass

Look upon a finished life.
There's nothing left recalled.
One Life it's graduation.
Black gown and cap to large.

I couldn’t wait to leave this place
The moment has arrived and I have tears streaming down my face.
Graduation is another one of my milestones.
Now I know I must face the world on my own.
I’ve waited for this moment for so long
Now I must go to college like I planned all along.
I’ll miss my friends that I’ve made.
My memories of high school will not fade.

He he he
Passed my degree.
Who ever thought I could.
Who ever thought I would.
Wearing trencher, gown and robes.
Wearing ceremonial academic clothes.

We were so proud of Lindsay
On her graduation day
She turned a fresh new corner
So much she had to say
For she had passed a milestone
What special memories
So beautiful and so talented
With wonderful qualities
Whatever she chose to do
We knew she’d do it well
Her family looked happily on
Full of pride, we could tell
Of course there are always
Bumps rising in the trail
But with Lindsay’s determination
How could she possibly fail?
It’s so wonderful to watch
Young people at their peak
So willing and so ready
For it’s knowledge that they seek
So we look at Lindsay’s pictures
We knew that she’d go far
Whatever direction she took
She’d be our special star!

No need to be confined in a net of knitted straws
no need to be afraid of lightning and thunders of the clouds
no need to hide behind the feathers of a mother bird
now you don't need the shoulders of a father bird.
The gown you wore is enough to protect you in the flights to come.
My daughter bird I know it's raining heavily
lightning and thunders of the clouds are frightening
but the gown is an umbrella against all evils of the clouds
ignoring the evils of the clouds be safe and secured
in the beautiful rains the clouds provide,
the pleasant winds will bounce back a little mild showers you need.
Beauty of rains is infinite and its threats are finite.
Now fly below the skies and pluck the twinkling diamonds.
We are here in the nest, the same old knitted net of straws.
Let us pay thanks to the kind and benevolent ancient light
filtered through the greenery of a tree
reflected and refracted that are still showing mini rainbows.
Forming a beam of shining dust particles of aging,
with a positive approach we can see even dust as a beauty.
Let us capture memories of incubating a beautiful egg
let us forget the fatigues of incubation,
and let us pay thanks to God who bestowed upon us
and gave us a right egg for incubation!

The most vicious and dangerous
Is the power greed!
This stems from an enormous
Ego!
Not an ordinary sized ego
But much, much bigger than
A mountain!
It is not like a solid structure either
Because an ego keeps growing
And expanding,
Moving and leaping
Into gigantic proportions!
It seldom diminishes,
It is like a balloon filled with helium,
Bloating and floating high in space!
The power greed stems from the
"I" sense.
Not the simple,
"I am the owner of this house"
But the notoriety of
"I want to be the owner of this earth."
The power greed is never satisfied,
It asks for things, again and again.
The greed plans the strategies,
As how one could be crowned as
The Dictator!
To be dreadfully important,
Powerfully holding everything under the thumb,
Not just people or countries,
But Mother Earth too!
All along the way,
Of becoming a powerful emperor,
The greedy pursuits are accompanied
By various ‘Himsas'!
Each thought, word, or deed
Is a game plan,
To cut and wipe out,
Annihilate and destroy,
The innocent ones!
When each cell of the body
Pulsates with power greed,
How can ‘Ahimsa' be practised?
To demolish the power-greed
One has to scorch the seed of
The violent and powerful ‘I'!

You are unseen but also captured
In minds of many you are featured,
You divert the child well nurtured,
On grazing by you animals are pastured.
Watching the innocent baby new born
You wait and hide to catch with turn,
While child grows little you blow horn
He starts telling things are my in morn.
You are just like colour changing lizard,
You fill in man really negative wizard.
In minds of many you do bring blizzard,
Fishes and birds enter food to gizzard.
By getting you animals loose a steer,
Birds fly with tending to fall with fear,
They fall in confusion who live in sheer,
You motivate for crime and sticks smear.
You do spoil life oh go away oh greed
People fight for hand of land, and seed.
Please do not stay for negative breed,
People are with God now and in creed.

Can you sleep
Knowing that
You killed her?
Her damned life
Needed you
Your power
Some sucking
Energy
From your plant
Your damn greed
Stole her life
Can you now sleep
Knowing she's dead?

With pain in neck he walked around,
all alone with just a frown.
All he wanted was there,
but reaching it seemed unfair.
All he wanted to do, he could,
But always wondered if he should.
What could he do with all his money?
all his expensive belongings seemed funny.
He had a mansion, garden a car,
but all the love was really far.
With pain in neck he walked around,
all alone with just a frown.
He deserved it, he totally did,
it was all because of his greed.
A young man, when he was,
he never even tried to measure his loss.
Now creeps him a pain,
when his dungeon walls are old and stained.
His billion pounds now have no use,
all he has lost, now what is there to loose?
With pain in neck he walked around,
all alone with just a frown.

The world's wrapped up in politics and loves big finance too
I find it quite depressing in large quantities, it's true
It's good to have the knowledge, and to know what's going on
But when it starts to rule the world, then everything goes wrong
There's so much hate out in this world, It's such a crying shame
People pointing fingers and so quick to place the blame
Intolerant of others, and unwilling to diffuse
With sociopaths in charge, war is always in the news
I wish that we could coexist, respect our fellow man
Quit hating other ways of life that we don't understand
But in politics and finance, war profiteering, grows and thrives
Yes, it's all about the money, not at all about the lives
I am not apathetic, I just can't stand it any more
I do not wish to witness so much suffering and war
If I focus on the travesty of all thats going down
I can not breathe, I suffocate, my spirit starts to drown

I hang from the top shelf of a hard life
like a dusty and old lambrequin
Thus tattered by parasitic mites and torn
from the sheer weight of my grasp
I gaze at the many rich food stuffs and prized
white elephants that safely exist
Just beyond my tried and failed reach in my futile
attempt to possess their reward
Like the meaningless shiny things carried back
to the nest by a greedy crow
And placed there in the sunny window
of its relatively darkened existence
Purely but significantly as a trophy to be
seen and thereby envied for its plumage
Though it be of anything other than a strictly
ornamental garnishment or trinket
With not even the abilities of a b_stard wing
let alone provision or stipulation
I hang from the top shelf of a hard life….
Not wanting to quit or give
When I still have the strength to hang on
ten seconds longer than the next guy….

Miss Reid's Speed Seeds Misread Red Weed Barrow Greed Screed
So much depends upon callow Monsanto’s
arrow minded rein reign
glazed with gain and, again, phrased with pain,
wheedling sallow farmers who see red
forced to furrow b[l]ushels of transgenic sterile crop seeds
on narrow plain
lots which soon lie fallow
rather than wide marrow
raised with rain
and fertile appetizers
Need greed's speed weed reeds

Greed has for no time any verse
It has only curse and curse
Yet I have written a tercet for this hellish vice.

As long as his dreams are alive,
Sure, he has a fair chance to survive,
He is moving on a dangerous track,
Why she is shouting, "He is a crack."
Why her eyes are wet, is it love?
He knows, he doesn't fly like a dove,
He knows it's a rope not a bridge,
The teen aged girl is standing on a ridge.
But his eyes are on her pink gown
He, a lover, who never looks down
Journey of his eyes from feet to face
Kissing and embracing her silky grace
It's the midway and his eyes are at rest
To get back his breaths the spot is the best
Looking into his eyes why she is shy?
Prayers for her lover! Looking at the sky!
The same crazy in disciplined naughty boy!
Different metals, can they form an alloy?
May be; love is a magic, a force a might
Anytime can change the wrong in the right
He's close to the heart, a valley to adore
Listen to the beats climb more, climb more
Here he is, he can see her dancing hips
Hands round the neck, lips on the lips!
Writing and stamping a wordless deed
Welcome, welcome if love is the greed!

Being Young and Green, I said in love's despite:
Never in the world will I to living wight
Give over, air my mind
To anyone,
Hang out its ancient secrets in the strong wind
To be shredded and faded—
Oh, me, invaded
And sacked by the wind and the sun!

On green days or blue days
how easy it is to talk with you
to fill our ears with vocal sumptuousness
and our hearts with delicious laughter
sharing secrets only we can understand.
So easy to talk with you
no matter where the body is
the mind can be elsewhere
(we can pick up where we left off
or leave off where we can pick up) .
There is no beginning and no end.
Only, the comfortable...now.

Three tall poplars beside the pool
Shiver and moan in the gusty blast,
The carded clouds are blown like wool,
And the yellowing leaves fly thick and fast.
The leaves, now driven before the blast,
Now flung by fits on the curdling pool,
Are tossed heaven-high and dropped at last
As if at the whim of a jabbering fool.
O leaves, once rustling green and cool!
Two met here where one moans aghast
With wild heart heaving towards the past:
Three tall poplars beside the pool.

It climbs the wall

Forty Word Poem.
My heart is yours
in all my dreams.
Eclipse of the moon
together we spoon.
Venus lends her glow.
She seems to know
our elation...for
tomorrow at sunrise
our hearts will fly
to the green Emerald
Island of Love.

Oh tiger green and sweetly blue
With honest eyes and very true,
How can we again meet
And each kindly treat,
When wise men say there is none you.
Oh bloom that comes again in spring
With green leaves that whisper and sing,
Fragrance so adorable
With colors splendid full,
Candid life to the world you bring.
Oh creature that man has killed
On your earth the blood has spilled,
And broken natures nest
For he thought he knew best,
With folly the forest he filled.
Oh tiger green and sweetly blue
You are now but a dream so true,
Of endangered species gone
That embrace of lead has done,
And soon others will follow you.
Oh Eden's garden's of concrete now
Like hearts of men are somehow,
Made out of chisel stones
Or yellow weathered bones,
A death comes with a blackish crow.
In days that are passed and away
I heard you roaring and play,
With beasts now all lost
Or returned to whited dust,
Like I will likewise do one day.
Oh creatures of this earth so wild
Why hasn’t man treated you mild?
He's within a soul too
But not as innocent nor true,
As one, so of freedom defiled.

The sun does arise,
And make happy the skies;
The merry bells ring
To welcome the spring;
The skylark and thrush,
The birds of the bush,
Sing louder around
To the bell's cheerful sound,
While our sports shall be seen
On the Echoing Green.
Old John with white hair,
Does laugh away care,
Sitting under the oak,
Among the old folk.
They laugh at our play,
And soon they all say:
'Such, such were the joys
When we all, girls and boys,
In our youth time were seen
On the Echoing Green.'
Till the little ones, weary,
No more can be merry;
The sun does descend,
And our sports have an end.
Round the laps of their mothers
Many sisters and brother,
Like birds in their nest,
Are ready for rest,
And sport no more seen
On the darkening Green.
.

THERE is a green hill far away,
Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.
We may not know, we cannot tell
What pains he had to bear,
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffer’d there.
He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to heaven,
Sav’d by his precious blood.
There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin;
He only could unlock the gate
Of heaven, and let us in.
O dearly, dearly has he lov’d,
And we must love him too,
And trust in his redeeming blood,
And try his works to do.

Everyday is always a bad hair day for me
Mine is very curly, they told me it's kinky
I have a hard time combing my hair, you see
Have to visit my hairdresser to fix it for me
It was very shiny, as straight as can be
It was always like these since I was a little lady
Now, I am used to see this everyday
Ummm, I don't see what happened to me
Getting up early in the morning is not that easy
I have to have a ribbon to hold it, the neighbors might see
Never mind If they laugh at me and call me crazy
I have a God who loves me and take care of me.
Hey! I am elated this way, God created me like that,
And no bad hair day will ever make me give it back,
Yes! Truly blessed to have hair as pleasing as can be,
Think what you want, I absolutely adore it. He he he!
Hmmm..not a bad hair day at all...I love it..! ! ! He he he

Do not envy his hair
Because he is blond
And you are not

My hair like Jesus wore it
Hallelujah I adore it
Hallelujah Mary loved her son
Why don't my mother love me?
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Flow it, show it
Long as God can grow it
My hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Flow it, show it
Long as God can grow it
My hair
(From the Musical 'Hair')
Hair today, gone tomorrow,
A lock of John Lennon’s hair was sold at auction.
But what I would ask is how sure it is John’s at all?
Did CSI London extract the DNA?
Did the dream team of OJ affirm that it was or wasn’t?
If the locket of hair doesn’t fit, you must acquit.
John’s body was cremated but there are his sons.
What if the sons gave the hair?
Seems to be a hairy question to me?
What about Prince Harry’s hair?
Is the auction price going to more than John’s?
Hair, There and Everywhere.
The hair styles that Beatles wore evoked certain level of social change,
Not to mention that John recognized,
-at rightfully so, - later on so not!
The Beatles were more popular than Christ,
-and of all his hair.
If a single Christ hair were to be found,
A single hair of the Lord would fetch more than John’s lock.

I am running my fingers
Through your hair
And your hair
Feels so
Soft
Like silk

Chief of organic Numbers!
Old Scholar of the Spheres!
Thy spirit never slumbers,
But rolls about our ears
For ever and for ever.
O, what a mad endeavour
Worketh he
Who, to thy sacred and ennobled hearse,
Would offer a burnt sacrifice of verse
And Melody!
How heavenward thou soundedst
Live Temple of sweet noise;
And discord unconfoundedst:
Giving delight new joys,
And Pleasure nobler pinions--
O where are thy Dominions!
Lend thine ear
To a young delian oath--aye, by thy soul,
By all that from thy mortal Lips did roll;
And by the Kernel of thine earthly Love,
Beauty, in things on earth and things above,
When every childish fashion
Has vanish'd from my rhyme
Will I grey-gone in passion
Give to an after-time
Hymning and harmony
Of thee, and of thy Words and of thy Life:
But vain is now the bruning and the strife--
Pangs are in vain -- until I grow high-rife
With Old Philosophy
And mad with glimpses at futurity!
For many years my offerings must be hush'd:
When I do speak I'll think upon this hour,
Because I feel my forehead hot and flush'd,
Even at the simplest vassal of thy Power,--
A Lock of thy bright hair!
Sudden it came,
And I was startled when I heard thy name
Coupled so unaware--
Yet, at the moment, temperate was my blood:
Methought I had beheld it from the flood.

I never gave a lock of hair away
To a man, dearest, except this to thee,
Which now upon my fingers thoughtfully,
I ring out to the full brown length and say
Take it.
My day of youth went yesterday;
My hair no longer bounds to my foot's glee,
Nor plant I it from rose or myrtle-tree,
As girls do, any more: it only may
Now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears,
Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
Through sorrow's trick. I thought the funeral-shears
Would take this first, but Love is justified,--
Take it thou,--finding pure, from all those years,
The kiss my mother left here when she died.

Thy hue, dear pledge, is pure and bright
As in that well - remember'd night
When first thy mystic braid was wove,
And first my Agnes whisper'd love.
Since then how often hast thou prest
The torrid zone of this wild breast,
Whose wrath and hate have sworn to dwell
With the first sin that peopled hell;
A breast whose blood's a troubled ocean,
Each throb the earthquake's wild commotion!
O if such clime thou canst endure
Yet keep thy hue unstain'd and pure,
What conquest o'er each erring thought
Of that fierce realm had Agnes wrought!
I had not wander'd far and wide
With such an angel for my guide;
Nor heaven nor earth could then reprove me
If she had lived and lived to love me.
Not then this world's wild joys had been
To me one savage hunting scene,
My sole delight the headlong race
And frantic hurry of the chase;
To start, pursue, and bring to bay,
Rush in, drag down, and rend my prey,
Then - from the carcass turn away!
Mine ireful mood had sweetness tamed,
And soothed each wound which pride inflamed: -
Yes, God and man might now approve me
If thou hadst lived and lived to love me!

Chords of the most beautiful song,
With my eyes, tracing the prominent
Vein that followed the course of his arm,
Round and round, over and once again,
In love, from the whole painting
To the small details and the even smaller
Obscure signature like a mark or a sign
Kept hidden, yet so visible.
For eyes that do not see what I see,
Will never find the perfect melody
I played mentally, while running
Long fingers and polished fingernails
Through those strings of His hair.
The moment, only created by a sudden
Bolt of beauty that dear Helios
Wished upon and for, for me
Can I only say thank you?
Such rays, soon soon they were gone;
I have but to ask the gods one more
Precious treasure by their hands given.
Eros, beloved Eros, have my heart as long
As his becomes mine, for I do not mind
just so I could render my song.
A tune for my heart; Oh let his youth
Be forever, diamond like;
So will my devotion to Thee.
For a whole minute, the whole world
All the unbelievable forces that we dare
Deny the existence of, re-arranged time
And life to, in a whole minute,
Replace my widowing heart and soul
And create the most sublime
Single measurement of time
That will forever and ever, eternally
Remind me of how gold and bold
Love can be.

There is a drunk boy in my bed and he smells.
I want him to leave so I can wash the sheets,
clean up,
arrange things, erase this episode
in my single hood.
Scandal, scandal, scandal, boys boys boys:
woke up this morning, no love in the bed.
You and I should meet for lunch. You can give me
advice. I sometimes feel judged. But that is from my
friends who aren't getting any.
Right now I guess I am wrapped up in the excitedness of it all.
But it is getting lonely here because most of my friends are getting
married.
One day, after all of this I will be married and happy and all that
Love, Anita.

Sometimes it flutters
Gaily round my sparkling smiles
Like a butterfly;
Sometimes it glides in the air
Like soap bubble- Touch- It pricks!

The great stone Hall is silent
that is now millennia old.
Through the western windows
shines a glorious sun.
It floods the walls and floors,
the tables, chairs and doors,
panelling, pictures, artefacts
and illumines every one
until the wraiths that gather
cry out in their joy,
'Everything is gold!
Whatever is, is gold! '
A majestic cloud
emerges from the southern sea,
slides across the western sky
blotting out the sun.
Light through those western windows
pales to a thin grey day.
It dims the walls and floors,
the tables, chairs and doors,
panelling, pictures, artefacts
pales every one
until the wraiths in the shadows
cry out in dismay,
'Gone is gold, the gold is gone!
All joy has passed away! '

To hear your smiles
To feel your joy
Your warm hearted laughter
spilling across my shoulder
Tender hands creating soft sighs
Then turning to see the light of the sky
as it bends to touch your eyes
Knowing you is a special happiness
A small child's hugging arm at my hip
The glistening shine on its plump lower lip,
quickly moistened after a delectable treat
Then the blush of color on the full
rounded cheek
This is a moment of happiness
A quiet night of deep restful sleep.
The wake to the languid, tingling, feeling, of reach
for arms that continue to keep on running to encircle one another
Yet open wide to welcome each others feats
This is the ultimate happiness

Happiness is that which everyone longs
but so few of us actually get
Happiness is that which rights all wrongs
and leaves us without regret
Why then does happiness torture us so
when all we want is to feel
what happiness does in the lowest of low
when everything just seems too real
Happiness comes to so many of you
you who think it will always be there
Happiness leaves you without the clue
that living without is a nightmare
If happiness could be passed on
would you then give it to me
Will you then cry when it is gone
and realise what it is to feel lonely
(May,2007)

Happiness is silent, or speaks equivocally for friends,
Grief is explicit and her song never ends,
Happiness is like England, and will not state a case,
Grief, like Guilt, rushes in and talks apace.

Provoked Thoughts
i find myself sitting
affront this velvet curtain
living an on-going lie
finding no thoughts of good
my shattered heart lost and empty
clinging to impossible dreams
a dreadful thought
my mind's eye sewn shut
with the thread of sorrow
spun from lost hope
not wanting to be found

One grand boulevard with trees
with one grand cafe in sun
with strong black coffee in very small cups.
One not necessarily very beautiful
man or woman who loves you.
One fine day.

If happiness only lies
In a place we don't exist
And only future days
Are one’s we miss
If satisfaction never comes
And dreams are unattained
Then you sacrificed your happiness
And only you’re to blame
The moment that we’re living
Should be lived with no regret
Don't let reaching for the future
Have you to obsessed
Find happiness
While you have your health
The evidence from pleasing others is
You may not please yourself

When I walked you home that night
The vibe was absolutely right
The sparks were flying left and right
Jesus I was happy
We talked and talked of this and that
Nothing more than vapid chat
I don’t remember what was said
More than words were talking
On and on we went like that
Playing off and bouncing back
So rare a thing to feel like that
You made me happy
Starry eyed and laughing
As we said good night and parted
And I floated helium hearted homeward
God you made me happy
That night when I went to bed
I couldn’t sleep my buzzing head
Was wondering what would happen next
And guess what, I was happy
That was now a month ago
I’ve seen you come I’ve watched you go
I’m wondering what the future holds
And how to make you happy.
I’d shower you with lies and gifts
I’d move the earth if we could live
Together you and me like this
Great God I’m happy.

Imagine, folks, he's barely up
and sits there with his coffee cup,
while reminiscing of the past
when time just flew, so very fast.
A sip of Java, then a nod,
it surely was the will of God,
this land where wheat has always grown
transformed,  a country of his own.
He had the guts, the fortitude
that saw some lawyers come unglued.
They said he had no valid reason
and that he was committing treason.
With musical formality
he built his principality.
It is well known that those who rule
attract corruption, like the fool
who speaks of better times to come.
For you it's water, he drinks rum.
Those 'servants' make for us decisions
while acting like all politicians,
we know that,  as they move their lips
they give us tons of clever fibs.
I say those people have a nerve,
they've got it wrong and make US  serve!
Well, I, for one, prefer to be
a common man, yet one who's free.
The world, as is, makes little sense
it lacks the word 'benevolence'.
And, if you think they are insane
you're right, they lost the word 'humane'.
Here, in a place called HRP
a Royal couple serves your tea.
So, when you make your travel plans,
the place where no shenanigans
or phony blokes pursue deception,
you'll get a personal reception.
Then stay a while, there, on the land
and shake the Royal couple's hand.
Look at the treasures, take it in,
the atmosphere, the smiles that win.
Today, throughout the world it rings,
the sound of bells for Queens and Kings.
Our voices, can you hear them call?
A Happy Birthday, from us all!

Happy Birthday to you,
Pure Poetry is a year old today,
All the sixty-one members seem to love you,
Because we keep putting poems on you,
Even the youngt members do too.
Members do find it hard to write poems,
But we do,
So happy birthday to you,
Hope you go on for another year,
So members can still write poems on you.

After they had not made love
she pulled the sheet up over her eyes
until he was buttoning his shirt:
not shyness for their bodies- those
they had willingly displayed- but a frail
endeavour to apologise.
Later, though, drawn together by
a distaste for such 'untidy ends'
they agreed to meet again; whereupon
they giggled, reminisced, held hands
as though what they had made was love-
and not that happier outcome- friends.

Happy he who like Ulysses
Happy he who like Ulysses has returned
successful from his travels, or like he
who sought the Golden Fleece, to rest well earned -
wise to the world - amongst his family.
When shall I see again my place of birth,
its chimney smoke, and at what time of year,
when seen that little, modest, plot of earth
which means far more to me than I draw here.
I’m drawn far more to my ancestral home
than to a Roman palace fine and proud,
prefer fine slate to marble, rather roam
along the Loire than sport midst Tiber’s crowd.
My Liré I prefer to Palatine,
and to sea air, soft climate Angevine.

Parody Joachim du Bellay 1515_1560 – Heureux qui comme Ulysse see below
Heureux qui, comme Ulysse, a fait un beau voyage
Heureux qui, comme Ulysse, a fait un beau voyage
Ou comme celui là qui conquit la toison,
Et puis est retourné, plein d’usage et raison,
Vivre entre ses parents le reste de son âge!
Quand reverrai-je, hélas, de mon petit village
Fumer la cheminée: et en quelle saison
Reverrai-je le clos de ma pauvre maison,
Qui m’est une province, et beaucoup d’avantage!
Plus me plaît le séjour qu’ont bâti mes ayeux,
Que des palais Romains le front audacieux:
Plus que le marbre dur me plaît l’ardoise fine,
Plus mon Loire Gaulois que le Tibre Latin,
Plus mon petit Liré que le mont Palatin,
Et plus que l’air marin la douceur Angevine.
Joachim du Bellay 1515_1560
Triste Qui, Comme Charles
Triste qui, comme Charles, a fait un beau mariage,
Et qui donc une fois conquise la toison,
Se retrouve chez soi, plein d’usage et raison,
Vivre entre ses parents le reste de son âge!
Quand donc reverra-t-il, sans ce remue-ménage
Fumer sa cheminée: et en quelle saison
Reverra-t-il le clos de Windsor et d’Eton,
Qui lui est royaume uni, et beaucoup d’avantages!
Plus lui plaît le séjour qu’ont bâti ses aïeux,
Que la face à Diane à[f]front audacieux:
Le palais brûlé - dur! - plaît plus qu’ardoise indigne,
Plus son livre Gallois que perdre son Latin,
Plus ses délires et rêves que le mont Vénusien,
Et plus que l’air malin la douceur Camilline.

Parody Joachim du Bellay 1515_1560 – Heureux qui comme Ulysse
Chicken Crossings
Heureux qui, tel Poulet, a fait un beau voyage
ou comme qui la ligne étroite et blanche passe
sans rire jaune aux oeufs bonnes que pour la casse,
retourne à ses parents pour pondre jusqu'à l'âge!
Quand reverrai-je le blé livré droit à ma cage
finement hormoné: et en quelle saison
reverrai-je le clos de ma pauvre maison,
qui m’est le poulailler, et beaucoup d’avantages?
Plus me plaît le séjour bâti pour mes aïeux,
que poulets aux sirènes, aux radars pernicieux:
plus que macadam dur me plaît l’ardoise fine,
plus ma gLoire plumée que les plumes laissées,
plus mes petits pondus que se faire écraser,
et plus que l’air malin la douceur Angevine.

Happy as the Cock
Happy proud rooster who has travelled far
Across life's stream with hens in indian file,
Preened white, red comb, and walked the gangplank trial
Penned in terse lines that verse bright humour's star.
Yearning for home, who roamed, to pen they are,
Assured of rest, returning, strut in style,
Say best nest eggs they'll lay, loud crow awhile.
Triumphant cock-a-doodle echoes jar
Hard-hearted humans who aren't up to par,
Eggs daily may not lay, nor soar mobile,
Current carried, fair through air agile,
Or cluck like duck to woodchuck.  Men, bizarre,
Chuckle they are born to lead, indeed
Know not lead rots hot head, heads for poor breed!

Happy the man, and happy he alone,
He who can call today his own:
He who, secure within, can say,
Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today.
Be fair or foul or rain or shine
The joys I have possessed, in spite of fate, are mine.
Not Heaven itself upon the past has power,
But what has been, has been, and I have had my hour.

I am happy,
You are happy,
We are happy to be both here;
It's so lovely,
Yes so lovely,
It's summertime in the air.
When a bloom's born in spring,
See how lovely it becomes,
With your heart along sing,
Wake up from winter’s glums;
Life is growing again,
From the old that's asleep,
From the mountains to glen,
All the flowers now reap.
You will be singing in tune,
With the wonders of time,
For the blossoms of June,
Fit like a song to a rime;
When all life comes in full,
With its growth and its skills,
No moment's longer dull,
There's just song in the hills.
I am happy,
You are happy,
It's the happiest time of the year;
It's so lovely,
Yes so lovely,
When life's growing everywhere.
Time renews all our wishes,
What grows old is born anew,
After some temporary glitches,
Again earth restores its debut.

A happy family is one blessed by God!
Both parents slog all life for their children;
And children honor parents, without rod;
All walk united en way to Heaven.
A happy family lives in piety;
Their home is warm and welcomes everyone;
They’re satisfied and live with satiety;
There’s time for love, care, work, play, also fun!
A happy family loves its neighbors well;
All share their joys, woes, grief and problems too;
Their faith in God, their smiling faces tell;
With divine aim, all earthly works, they do!
A happy family prays in harmony;
God meets their needs of body, soul, money!

O FAR away, and far away,
The Happy Islands lie;
In bluer seas of calm than these,
Beneath a bluer sky.
The sea, a shining girdle, winds
Round cliff and cape and bay,
With flash and gleam, and there they dream,
O far and far away!
Upon a rim of sapphire sea,
As some sweet girl might lean
Her breast of snow, my Islands glow,
All exquisite and green.
The cliffs like shining ramparts rise,
The golden beaches gleam;
And thro' the hills sing silver rills,
And cataract and stream.
Bright in a mist of leaves, on height
And headland, waving high,
The flame-flowers lean, and burn between
Splendours of sea and sky.
The still, bright forests, massed and green,
Like painted woodlands glow
In shade and shine; and belts of pine
Climb up to meet the snow.
No burning drought with fevered breath,
Nor blight of bitter hail,
Blackens the yield of fruitful field,
Nor sears the flowery vale.
Ah me! my Isles! my Happy Isles!
The Isles that nurtured me;
My heart is fain to cross again
Those leagues of purple sea,—
To watch at sunset from the hills
The headlands fade in mist,
'Mid changing glows, of gold and rose
And Bloom-of-Amethyst.
I tread to-day a sunless strand
Under sad skies of grey,
But summer smiles in my fair Isles
So far and far away.

I hate the way you tease me,
I hate the way you walk.
I hate the way you look at me,
I hate the way you talk.
I hate the way you run around,
I hate the way you speak.
I hate the way you write your words,
I hate the way you greet.
I hate the way you srut around
like you have it all,
but most of all
I hate the way I don't hate you at all.

Have I ever hurt you?
Hit you?
Pierced you?
Have I ever made you cry?
Scream?
Want to die?
Have I given you shit that screws up your life?
Like drugs, or alcohol, that makes you high?
Have I handed a dagger to you?
Point a gun at your head?
Tie a string around your neck?
Leave you alone with some cold crimson instrument?
Have I ever asked you to sell yourself short?
Did I tell you something was impossible?
Have I ever told you ‘dude, you’re sucha piece of shit’?
Have I done or said something,
To make you want to hurt yourself?
Have I ever put shit on your shoulders?
Prepared you for the slaughters?
Have I said to you
‘there is no way your gunna make it through this life’?
Do I make you think life sucks?
That everything has locks?
Have I made you feel lonely?
Hopeless?
Or immense negativity?
Have I threatened to kill you?
Beat you?
Hurt you?
Made you shed tears?
Blood?
Prayers?
Have I ever made you scream from inner pain?
Deep fears,
That can’t be slain?
Do I hate you?

Hate me when I hate myself
Hate me when I love myself
Just hate me you know you do
Hate me when I say I do
Blame me for every thing
Blame me for all the lies
Just blame me when something’s wrong
Blame me when you need to
Fight me on everything
Fight me when you’re mad at her
Fighting me makes it ok
So fight me every single day
Love me what I love myself
Love me when I hate myself
Just love me you know you do
Love me when you say you do

there is so much hate,
and not enough joy
to balance all things out,
and when you get overwhelmed
you just want to shout.
to the heavens above
to the earth below
to everyone around.
but even though you open your mouth,
no one hears a sound.
is it because they were born deaf to the world
or because they choose to be
someone who doesn't give a crap
about what happens to you or me.
i guess what i'm saying is that we need to act,
don't leave it up to fate,
because so many things can go wrong
that we cannot help but hate.

I hate it when you look at me
I hate it when you smile
I hate it when you catch my eye
I hate it when you lie
I hate it when you just walkout
I hate it when you shout
I hate it when you think you know
I hate it when you say hello
I hate it when you think I care
I hate it when you glare
I hate the way you stare
And never look mad
I hate the way you love me
Like I was the only one you had
I hate that I can’t hate you even if I tried
And don’t forget that I only saying all this
b\c I can never hate you

I hate the way you treat me
I hate that everything is how you want it to be
I hate all your lies and silly games
I hate how you make them all the same
I hate that I feel this way
I hate that I can't take the pain away
I hate that I'm your back bone
I hate being in the same zone
I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the pain won't heal
I hate that you are too blind to see
I hate that I want to leave
I hate not wanting to be around
I hate your mouth that produces bad sounds
I hate a lot of other things too
But I hate that you make me hate you

i hate you kyle
and i love josh
so i hope that hurts you
and i hope your heart
is filled with pain and anger
i hope you die
a slow and painful death
and i hope that im
the one who caused it

Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
And do not drop in for an after-loss.
Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe;
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
To linger out a purposed overthrow.
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
When other petty griefs have done their spite,
But in the onset come; so shall I taste
At first the very worst of fortune's might,
And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.

Heaven is not a place; it is a state;
not in the clouds, nor here on earth beneath;
heaven's not in front, behind, nor left nor right -
and yet, in love it comprehends all these.
God is not found by silence, nor by speech;
not found by fasting, nor by finest food;
not by seclusion, nor by company -
and yet, within all these, and all around.
There's nowhere, thus, to go; for all is here;
and nought to do but, present, here to rest;
and resting, wish and will and love God dear
with full intent; no other interest.
All's within the heart, so vast, so great -
for heaven's not a place; it is a state.

Hearts bleed a beautiful red, like a curtain to our love
We walk through slowly like we don't even hear a sound
With each step we take new comfort and salvation is found
We walk together like we don't have a care in the world
I saw a beautiful heaven there when I looked above
We walked though together and the white clouds did their best but
Our first steps left us hanging in a nameless ten month rut
Since then angels did sing, It was salvation that I found
I saw the burning pits of hell and how they called my name
I stumbled in uncertain, your pretty face not around
So I let my body rest there, dead in the burning ground
Winter woke me suddenly with it's chills, you're not there still
I looked up, saw you in heaven, you smiled bright like a star
He made you happy, I thought to myself 'Stay where you are,
My heart is done now and forever, love has left it's scar, '
So I grabbed my knees and pulled them close so I'd fall asleep
I dreamed of far better times far before my fall to hell
Before it froze over and gave me this story to tell
I dreamt that you kissed broken me upon my pale blue cheek
but I looked over at you and my wide eyes did not blink
That's when I learned my lesson, not to play with caring hearts
It's not so easy to pick up the pieces when it falls apart
Your heart gets shakey and forever easily scared
I'm so sorry that I took for granted that you cared
Now I walk in beautiful heaven again with burned wings
You make me so happy that I forget that my heart stings
I've never been this happy so I need you to understand
From time to time I still close my weary eyes and wonder
If I'm still dreaming...

Father in heaven,
Here I am
Ready to listen to your voice
To heed to your instructions
And Follow your very word
Father in heaven
My maker, Earth’s creator
My being a special design
Am an original from you
Your word a label that fulfills
My every desire
Father in heaven
Father of my peace
With Joy satisfied
My life a gift
From you daddy
Father in Heaven
I come before your throne
Just to say Thank you
For all you have done
Thanks for everything daddy.

"Heaven" has different Signs—to me—
Sometimes, I think that Noon
Is but a symbol of the Place—
And when again, at Dawn,
A mighty look runs round the World
And settles in the Hills—
An Awe if it should be like that
Upon the Ignorance steals—
The Orchard, when the Sun is on—
The Triumph of the Birds
When they together Victory make—
Some Carnivals of Clouds—
The Rapture of a finished Day—
Returning to the West—
All these—remind us of the place
That Men call "paradise"—
Itself be fairer—we suppose—
But how Ourself, shall be
Adorned, for a Superior Grace—
Not yet, our eyes can see—

What happens in heaven?
Will I sit on a cloud?
Is walking or talking
Or jumping allowed?
Will I be on my own
Or with some of my friends?
Does it go on for ever
Or eventually end?
What happens in heaven?
Will I play a harp's strings?
I can't play piano
I can't even sing.
Who chooses the music
That angels inspire?
Who does the auditions
For the heavenly choir?
What happens in heaven?
Are the streets paved with gold?
Is it crowded with people
Who're incredibly old?
Will I know who I am?
Will I know what I'm called?
If I pinch myself hard
Will I feel it at all?
What happens in heaven?
Do I go through a gate?
What if I get myself lost
Or turn up too late?
Is my name on a list?
Is the gatekeeper nice?
Can you sneak in for nothing
Or is there a price?

There are so many times
when I see somebody that is old
I mean............very old
and the first thing I think of is............
''Can I give you a message
to take to my dad? ''
I have never had the nerve
to actually ask them.
But I want to.
Then, when they die......
I'm filled with regret.
I'm kicking myself
for missing the opportunity
to talk to my dad.
I've known many elderly people.
Most of them seem ready
to die and meet their maker.
Some of them even talk about it.
I choke on my words.
I try so hard to spit them out
but I can't.
I don't want to make them sad.
I don't want them to know
that I know they are going
to die soon.
I will send a message to heaven.
One day I will get the nerve
to ask somebody that knows
they will be there soon.
I'll ask them to ''look my dad up''
and ''Tell him I love him''.
Until then, I'll secretly wish
they could read my mind.

All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful,
The Lord God made them all.
Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colours,
He made their tiny wings.
The rich man in his castle,
The poor man at his gate,
God made them, high or lowly,
And ordered their estate.
The purple-headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset, and the morning,
That brightens up the sky;
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one.
The tall trees in the greenwood,
The meadows where we play,
The rushes by the water,
We gather every day;--
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell,
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.

Drifting on wings of an agnel,
The stairway to Heaven unfolds,
The steps leading up to a city,
The pathways transparent of gold.
At the base of the ascending staircase,
A lamb sits soft at the door,
Surrounded by lilies and lions,
Grace has transcended the roars.
The Lamb offers peace in His presence,
Your fears He'll caress like a dove,
The soft gentle fleece of His body,
Will cover you up in His love.
Then soft as the wings of an agnel,
He'll carry your cares to the door,
The Lamb knows the steps of the staircase,
He's traveled this pathway before.
The bright shining lights at the entrance,
Glowing like elegant gems,
Reflect the love of His shepherd,
As he beckons His Lamb to come in.
All of your burdens and heartaches,
Which the Lamb has offered to bear,
He lays at the feet of the Shepherd,
Whose love has invited them there.
Then drifting on wings of an angel,
The stairway to Heaven descends,
The powerful peace of the Lion,
Waiting soft in the heart of the Lamb.

There is an angel in heaven,
He's awake until eleven;
You can hold to his hand
And he'll try to understand,
Why your heart is angry and bitter,
- And he'll try to make it fitter
So the future for you will glitter.
There are roads to walk across
And you are your only boss,
But your angel will guide you through
Because he knows what to do;
So don't let your hope become lost
Or frostbitten in your frost.
Be saved by an angel, who tries,
He knows both your lowness and highs;
Find refuge in love and kindness,
- Hope you try this and God bless.

Sometimes she is a child within mine arms,
Cowering beneath dark wings that love must chase,--
With still tears showering and averted face,
Inexplicably fill'd with faint alarms:
And oft from mine own spirit's hurtling harms
I crave the refuge of her deep embrace,--
Against all ills the fortified strong place
And sweet reserve of sovereign counter-charms.
And Love, our light at night and shade at noon,
Lulls us to rest with songs, and turns away
All shafts of shelterless tumultuous day.
Like the moon's growth, his face gleams through his tune;
And as soft waters warble to the moon,
Our answering spirits chime one roundelay.

In the big fire at Mancini's their house and it's contents were destroyed
And the story of their bad luck it has travelled far and wide
But the story it would have been worse if human lives were lost
Though the financial damage to the family it comes at a great cost.
Clothes left to dry by an electric heater was how the fire began
And as from her burning premises Mrs Mancini ran
She shouted my baby is in there and young Bill who lives nearby
Rushed into the smoke filled bedroom to where he heard the baby cry.
He snatched the baby from her cot and with her rushed outside
And handed her to her weeping mother who in tears was overjoyed
And though the hero an unlikely one he surely saved the day
And about him Mr and Mrs Mancini only have good things to say.
Billy in his early twenties on himself he makes life hard
From his local pub for fighting for six months he has been barred
But the villian has become a hero since he risked his life to save
The life of a six months baby girl when most needed he was brave.
The one seen as a villian an unlikely hero of today
And where the faint hearted dare not venture great courage he did display
Last week he was seen as a rowdy people on him now heap praise
And the story of his bravery those who know him do amaze.

''Healfast, healfast, ye hero wounds;
O knight, be quickly strong!
Beloved strife
For fame and life,
Oh, tarry not too long!''

No longer could the Day nor Destinies
Delay the Night, who now did frowning rise
Into her throne; and at her humorous breasts
Visions and Dreams lay sucking: all men's rests
Fell like the mists of death upon their eyes,
Day's too-long darts so kill'd their faculties.
The Winds yet, like the flowers, to cease began;
For bright Leucote, Venus' whitest swan,
That held sweet Hero dear, spread her fair wings,
Like to a field of snow, and message brings
From Venus to the Fates, t'entreat them lay
Their charge upon the Winds their rage to stay,
That the stern battle of the seas might cease,
And guard Leander to his love in peace.
The Fates consent;--ay me, dissembling Fates!
They showed their favours to conceal their hates,
And draw Leander on, lest seas too high
Should stay his too obsequious destiny:
Who like a fleering slavish parasite,
In warping profit or a traitorous sleight,
Hoops round his rotten body with devotes,
And pricks his descant face full of false notes;
Praising with open throat, and oaths as foul
As his false heart, the beauty of an owl;
Kissing his skipping hand with charmed skips,
That cannot leave, but leaps upon his lips
Like a cock-sparrow, or a shameless quean
Sharp at a red-lipp'd youth, and naught doth mean
Of all his antic shows, but doth repair
More tender fawns, and takes a scatter'd hair
From his tame subject's shoulder; whips and calls
For everything he lacks; creeps 'gainst the walls
With backward humbless, to give needless way:
Thus his false fate did with Leander play.
First to black Eurus flies the white Leucote
(Born 'mongst the negroes in the Levant sea,
On whose curl'd heads the glowing sun doth rise),
And shows the sovereign will of Destinies,
To have him cease his blasts; and down he lies.
Next, to the fenny Notus course she holds,
And found him leaning, with his arms in folds,
Upon a rock, his white hair full of showers;
And him she chargeth by the fatal powers,
To hold in his wet cheeks his cloudy voice.
To Zephyr then that doth in flowers rejoice:
To snake-foot Boreas next she did remove,
And found him tossing of his ravished love,
To heat his frosty bosom hid in snow;
Who with Leucote's sight did cease to blow.
Thus all were still to Hero's heart's desire;
Who with all speed did consecrate a fire
Of flaming gums and comfortable spice,
To light her torch, which in such curious price
She held, being object to Leander's sight,
That naught but fires perfumed must give it light.
She loved it so, she griev'd to see it burn,
Since it would waste, and soon to ashes turn:
Yet, if it burned not, 'twere not worth her eyes;
What made it nothing, gave it all the prize.
Sweet torch, true glass of our society!
What man does good, but he consumes thereby?
But thou wert loved for good, held high, given show;
Poor virtue loathed for good, obscured, held low:
Do good, be pined,--be deedless good, disgraced;
Unless we feed on men, we let them fast.
Yet Hero with these thoughts her torch did spend:
When bees make wax, Nature doth not intend
It should be made a torch; but we, that know
The proper virtue of it, make it so,
And, when 'tis made, we light it: nor did Nature
Propose one life to maids; but each such creature
Makes by her soul the best of her free state,
Which without love is rude, disconsolate,
And wants love's fire to make it mild and bright,
Till when, maids are but torches wanting light.
Thus 'gainst our grief, not cause of grief, we fight:
The right of naught is glean'd, but the delight.
Up went she: but to tell how she descended,
Would God she were dead, or my verse ended!
She was the rule of wishes, sum, and end,
For all the parts that did on love depend:
Yet cast the torch his brightness further forth;
But what shines nearest best, holds truest worth.
Leander did not through such tempests swim
To kiss the torch, although it lighted him:
But all his powers in her desires awaked,
Her love and virtues clothed him richly naked.
Men kiss but fire that only shows pursue;
Her torch and Hero, figure show and virtue.
Now at opposed Abydos naught was heard
But bleating flocks, and many a bellowing herd,
Slain for the nuptials; cracks of falling woods;
Blows of broad axes; pourings out of floods.
The guilty Hellespont was mix'd and stained
With bloody torrents that the shambles rained;
Not arguments of feast, but shows that bled,
Foretelling that red night that followed.
More blood was spilt, more honours were addrest,
Than could have graced any happy feast;
Rich banquets, triumphs, every pomp employs
His sumptuous hand; no miser's nuptial joys.
Air felt continual thunder with the noise
Made in the general marriage-violence;
And no man knew the cause of this expense,
But the two hapless lords, Leander's sire,
And poor Leander, poorest where the fire
Of credulous love made him most rich surmis'd:
As short was he of that himself he prized,
As is an empty gallant full of form,
That thinks each look an act, each drop a storm,
That falls from his brave breathings; most brought up
In our metropolis, and hath his cup
Brought after him to feasts; and much palm bears
For his rare judgment in th' attire he wears;
Hath seen the hot Low-Countries, not their heat,
Observes their rampires and their buildings yet;
And, for your sweet discourse with mouths, is heard
Giving instructions with his very beard;
Hath gone with an ambassador, and been
A great man's mate in travelling, even to Rhene;
And then puts all his worth in such a face
As he saw brave men make, and strives for grace
To get his news forth: as when you descry
A ship, with all her sail contends to fly
Out of the narrow Thames with winds unapt,
Now crosseth here, then there, then this way rapt,
And then hath one point reach'd, then alters all,
And to another crooked reach doth fall
Of half a bird-bolt's shoot, keeping more coil
Than if she danc'd upon the ocean's toil;
So serious is his trifling company,
In all his swelling ship of vacantry
And so short of himself in his high thought
Was our Leander in his fortunes brought,
And in his fort of love that he thought won;
But otherwise he scorns comparison.
O sweet Leander, thy large worth I hide
In a short grave! ill-favour'd storms must chide
Thy sacred favour; I in floods of ink
Must drown thy graces, which white papers drink,
Even as thy beauties did the foul black seas;
I must describe the hell of thy decease,
That heaven did merit: yet I needs must see
Our painted fools and cockhorse peasantry
Still, still usurp, with long lives, loves, and lust,
The seats of Virtue, cutting short as dust
Her dear-bought issue: ill to worse converts,
And tramples in the blood of all deserts.
Night close and silent now goes fast before
The captains and the soldiers to the shore,
On whom attended the appointed fleet
At Sestos' bay, that should Leander meet,
Who feigned he in another ship would pass:
Which must not be, for no one mean there was
To get his love home, but the course he took.
Forth did his beauty for his beauty look,
And saw her through her torch, as you behold
Sometimes within the sun a face of gold,
Formed in strong thoughts, by that tradition's force
That says a god sits there and guides his course.
His sister was with him; to whom he show'd
His guide by sea, and said, 'Oft have you view'd
In one heaven many stars, but never yet
In one star many heavens till now were met.
See, lovely sister! see, now Hero shines,
No heaven but her appears; each star repines,
And all are clad in clouds, as if they mourned
To be by influence of earth out-burned.
Yet doth she shine, and teacheth Virtue's train
Still to be constant in hell's blackest reign,
Though even the gods themselves do so entreat them
As they did hate, and earth as she would eat them.'
Off went his silken robe, and in he leapt,
Whom the kind waves so licorously cleapt,
Thickening for haste, one in another, so,
To kiss his skin, that he might almost go
To Hero's tower, had that kind minute lasted.
But now the cruel Fates with Ate hasted
To all the winds, and made them battle fight
Upon the Hellespont, for either's right
Pretended to the windy monarchy;
And forth they brake, the seas mixed with the sky,
And tossed distressed Leander, being in hell,
As high as heaven: bliss not in height doth dwell.
The Destinies sate dancing on the waves,
To see the glorious Winds with mutual braves
Consume each other: O, true glass, to see
How ruinous ambitious statists be
To their own glories! Poor Leander cried
For help to sea-born Venus she denied;
To Boreas, that, for his Atthaea's sake
He would some pity on his Hero take,
And for his own love's sake, on his desires;
But Glory never blows cold Pity's fires.
Then call'd he Neptune, who, through all the noise,
Knew with affright his wreck'd Leander's voice,
And up he rose; for haste his forehead hit
'Gainst heaven's hard crystal; his proud waves he smit
With his forked sceptre, that could not obey;
Much greater powers than Neptune's gave them sway.
They loved Leander so, in groans they brake
When they came near him; and such space did take
'Twixt one another, loath to issue on,
That in their shallow furrows earth was shown,
And the poor lover took a little breath:
But the curst Fates sate spinning of his death
On every wave, and with the servile Winds
Tumbled them on him. And now Hero finds,
By that she felt, her dear Leander's state:
She wept, and prayed for him to every Fate;
And every Wind that whipped her with her hair
About the face, she kissed and spake it fair,
Kneeled to it, gave it drink out of her eyes
To quench his thirst: but still their cruelties
Even her poor torch envied, and rudely beat
The baiting flame from that dear food it eat;
Dear, for it nourish'd her Leander's life;
Which with her robe she rescued from their strife;
But silk too soft was such hard hearts to break;
And she, dear soul, even as her silk, faint, weak,
Could not preserve it; out, O, out it went!
Leander still call'd Neptune, that now rent
His brackish curls, and tore his wrinkled face,
Where tears in billows did each other chase;
And, burst with ruth, he hurl'd his marble mace
At the stern Fates: it wounded Lachesis
That drew Leander's thread, and could not miss
The thread itself, as it her hand did hit,
But smote it full, and quite did sunder it.
The more kind Neptune raged, the more he razed
His love's life's fort, and kill'd as he embraced:
Anger doth still his own mishap increase;
If any comfort live, it is in peace.
O thievish Fates, to let blood, flesh, and sense,
Build two fair temples for their excellence,
To robe it with a poisoned influence!
Though souls' gifts starve, the bodies are held dear
In ugliest things; sense-sport preserves a bear:
But here naught serves our turns: O heaven and earth,
How most-most wretched is our human birth!
And now did all the tyrannous crew depart,
Knowing there was a storm in Hero's heart,
Greater than they could make, and scorn'd their smart.
She bow'd herself so low out of her tower,
That wonder 'twas she fell not ere her hour,
With searching the lamenting waves for him:
Like a poor snail, her gentle supple limb
Hung on her turret's top, so most downright,
As she would dive beneath the darkness quite,
To find her jewel;--jewel!--her Leander,
A name of all earth's jewels pleas'd not her
Like his dear name: 'Leander, still my choice,
Come naught but my Leander! O my voice,
Turn to Leander! henceforth be all sounds,
Accents and phrases, that show all griefs' wounds,
Analyzed in Leander! O black change!
Trumpets, do you, with thunder of your clange,
Drive out this change's horror! My voice faints:
Where all joy was, now shriek out all complaints!'
Thus cried she; for her mixed soul could tell
Her love was dead: and when the Morning fell
Prostrate upon the weeping earth for woe,
Blushes, that bled out of her cheeks, did show
Leander brought by Neptune, bruis'd and torn
With cities' ruins he to rocks had worn,
To filthy usuring rocks, that would have blood,
Though they could get of him no other good.
She saw him, and the sight was much-much more
Than might have serv'd to kill her: should her store
Of giant sorrows speak?--Burst,--die,--bleed,
And leave poor plaints to us that shall succeed.
She fell on her love's bosom, hugged it fast,
And with Leander's name she breathed her last.
Neptune for pity in his arms did take them,
Flung them into the air, and did awake them
Like two sweet birds, surnam'd th' Acanthides,
Which we call Thistle-warps, that near no seas
Dare ever come, but still in couples fly,
And feed on thistle-tops, to testify
The hardness of their first life in their last;
The first, in thorns of love, that sorrows past:
And so most beautiful their colours show,
As none (so little) like them; her sad brow
A sable velvet feather covers quite,
Even like the forehead-cloth that, in the night,
Or when they sorrow, ladies use to wear:
Their wings, blue, red, and yellow, mixed appear:
Colours that, as we construe colours, paint
Their states to life;--the yellow shows their saint,
The dainty Venus, left them; blue their truth;
The red and black, ensigns of death and ruth.
And this true honour from their love-death sprung,--
They were the first that ever poet sung.

Said he: "You saw the Master clear;
By Rushy Pond alone he sat,
Serene and silent as a seer,
in tweedy coat and seedy hat.
you tell me you did not intrude,
(Although his book was in your hand,)
Upon his melancholy mood . . .
I do not understand.
"You did not tell him: 'I have come
From o'er the sea to speak to you.'
You did not dare, your lips were dumb . . .
You thought a little zephyr blew
From Rushy Pond a touch of him
You'll cherish to your dying day,
Perhaps with tears your eyes were dim . . .
And then - you went away.
"And down the years you will proclaim:
'O call me dullard, dub me dunce!
But let this be my meed of fame:
I looked on Thomas Hardy once.
Aye, by a stile I stood a span
And with these eyes did plainly see
A little, shrinking, shabby man . . .
But Oh a god to me!'"
Said I: "'Tis true, I scarce dared look,
yet he would have been kind, I'm sure;
But though I clutched his precious book
I feared to beg his signature.
Ah yes, my friend, I merit mirth.
You're bold, you have the right to laugh,
And if Christ came again to earth
You'd cadge his autograph."

I sit in the chair that he sat in,
And sleep in the bed where he slept,
The silence is loud to my hearing,
How many times now, have I wept.
I view all the things that he collected,
Knowing how he cherished them too,
And here in my heart he will linger,
Because he was the one, of value.
He was my love and my hero,
My right hand and my sounding board,
A husband and friend, right up to the end,
For us there was never discord.
I sit in the chair that he sat in,
And remember how close we became,
He'll always be with me in spirit,
I'm so proud to have taken his name.

i caught a frog and put him in a
fishbowl
and said,
'now you know how i feel.'
and he swam to the
bottom
and
drowned himself.

He is a hero
not by sibling ordinal age,
nor by fate.
He did not choose
whatever he became.
You see . . . his father drank himself
out of fortune, family, and prestige,
right into the nothingness
of the streets.
Cold and motionless,
without anyone
to claim what remained,
a city dump truck
took him to the grave.
Not just any power greater than he
but The Lord alone,
led the hero to success
and . . . away from alcohol.

The wind blew out from Bergen from the dawning to the day,
There was a wreck of trees and fall of towers a score of miles away,
And drifted like a livid leaf I go before its tide,
Spewed out of house and stable, beggared of flag and bride.
The heavens are bowed about my head, shouting like seraph wars,
With rains that might put out the sun and clean the sky of stars,
Rains like the fall of ruined seas from secret worlds above,
The roaring of the rains of God none but the lonely love.
Feast in my hall, O foemen, and eat and drink and drain,
You never loved the sun in heaven as I have loved the rain.
The chance of battle changes -- so may all battle be;
I stole my lady bride from them, they stole her back from me.
I rent her from her red-roofed hall, I rode and saw arise,
More lovely than the living flowers the hatred in her eyes.
She never loved me, never bent, never was less divine;
The sunset never loved me, the wind was never mine.
Was it all nothing that she stood imperial in duresse?
Silence itself made softer with the sweeping of her dress.
O you who drain the cup of life, O you who wear the crown,
You never loved a woman's smile as I have loved her frown.
The wind blew out from Bergen to the dawning of the day,
They ride and run with fifty spears to break and bar my way,
I shall not die alone, alone, but kin to all the powers,
As merry as the ancient sun and fighting like the flowers.
How white their steel, how bright their eyes! I love each laughing knave,
Cry high and bid him welcome to the banquet of the brave.
Yea, I will bless them as they bend and love them where they lie,
When on their skulls the sword I swing falls shattering from the sky.
The hour when death is like a light and blood is like a rose, --
You never loved your friends, my friends, as I shall love my foes.
Know you what earth shall lose to-night, what rich uncounted loans,
What heavy gold of tales untold you bury with my bones?
My loves in deep dim meadows, my ships that rode at ease,
Ruffling the purple plumage of strange and secret seas.
To see this fair earth as it is to me alone was given,
The blow that breaks my brow to-night shall break the dome of heaven.
The skies I saw, the trees I saw after no eyes shall see,
To-night I die the death of God; the stars shall die with me;
One sound shall sunder all the spears and break the trumpet's breath:
You never laughed in all your life as I shall laugh in death.

Ten years ago he was a hero a parade for him in the Town
But now he is seen as a has been they built him up and dragged him down
Where are they now when he most needs them him they no longer wish to know
He now is one of the forgotten their hero of a decade ago.
When he kicked the winning goal in the final he done himself and the club proud
The band played for him in his Hometown and the cheering for him it was loud
Alcohol now is the only comfort of a man who was a sporting king
His glory days for him are over his praises they no longer sing.
Some of him say he once was a hero his brown hair is now turning gray
And though only in his mid thirties he has known a far better day
In his honour they had big parties to him their toasting glasses they did raise
But now they have another hero another one that they can praise.
Ten years ago he was a hero when he was in his glorious prime
The Town Councillors sung his praises and the poets by him inspired to rhyme
The goal he kicked for his Club in the final happened to be the winning score
But now he is Yesteryear's hero though he is only thirty four

It's all so familiar and clear,
My eye's accustomed to every turn;
I'm not mistaken- I'm at home;
The wallpaper flowers, the chains of books...
I don't disturb yesterday's ashes -
The fire here has long gone cold.
Like a snake surveying its molted skin,
I gaze upon what I was.
Though many hymns remain unsung
And many blessings unbestowed,
I sense the glint of a different world,
A chance for new perfection!
I am called to unknown mountain peaks
By the chorus of spring,
And these letters from a woman
Lie in a cold, lifeless pile!
Dewdrops shine like eyes in the sun,
As if everything were splashed with silver...
My staff awaits me at the door!
I'm coming! I'm coming alone!

Far from my heavenly home,
Far from my Father’s breast,
Fainting I cry, blest Spirit, come
And speed me to my rest.
My spirit homeward turns
And fain would thither flee;
My heart, O Zion, droops and yearns,
When I remember thee.
To thee, to thee I press,
A dark and toilsome road;
When shall I pass the wilderness,
And reach the saint’s abode?
God of my life, be near;
On Thee my hopes I cast:
O guide me through the desert here,
And bring me home at last.

SHE turn’d the fair page with her fairer hand—
More fair and frail than it was wont to be—
O’er each remember’d thing he lov’d to see
She linger’d, and as with a fairy’s wand
Enchanted it to order. Oft she fann’d
New motes into the sun; and as a bee
Sings thro’ a brake of bells, so murmur’d she,
And so her patient love did understand
The reliquary room. Upon the sill
She fed his favorite bird. “Ah, Robin, sing!
He loves thee.” Then she touches a sweet string
Of soft recall, and towards the Eastern hill
Smiles all her soul—for him who cannot hear
The raven croaking at his carrion ear.

My home sweet home!
You are better than Venice,
You are better than Rome,
Your streets with crimes,
Explosions and killings,
You have lovely rimes.
I know the dwellers,
I can talk anyone,
Don't find the strangers.
Whereat I can walk,
In the powerless nights,
And complete dark.
Where dogs on way,
Don't bark at me,
Fearless of bites and betray.
I know your demerits,
I am used to with it,
And love your merits.
Whereat I can drive my old lovely bike,
And can go to a place of my choice and like.
Everything is familiar and nothing is new,
May be it a fog or it may be dew.
They all know me and I know them all,
At home, I know what to do if I fall.
Nice may be Venice and lovely may be Rome,
I want to go back to my home, sweet home.

1     The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home,
2     'Tis summer, the darkies are gay,
3     The corn top's ripe and the meadow's in the bloom
4     While the birds make music all the day.
5     The young folks roll on the little cabin floor,
6     All merry, all happy and bright:
7     By'n by Hard Times comes a knocking at the door,
8     Then my old Kentucky Home, good night!
9     [Chorus] Weep no more, my lady, oh! weep no more to-day!
10   We will sing one song
11   For the old Kentucky Home,
12   For the old Kentucky Home, far away.
13   [Solo] They hunt no more for the possum and the coon
14   On the meadow, the hill and the shore,
15   They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon,
16   On the bench by the old cabin door.
17   The day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart,
18   With sorrow where all was delight:
19   The time has come when the darkies have to part,
20   Then my old Kentucky Home, good-night!
21   [Chorus] Weep no more, my lady, oh! weep no more to-day!
22   We will sing one song
23   For the old Kentucky Home,
24   For the old Kentucky Home, far away.
25   [Solo] The head must bow and the back will have to bend,
26   Wherever the darkey may go:
27   A few more days, and the trouble all will end
28   In the field where the sugar-canes grow.
29   A few more days for to tote the weary load,
30   No matter 'twill never be light,
31   A few more days till we totter on the road,
32   Then my old Kentucky Home, good-night!
33   [Chorus] Weep no more, my lady, oh! weep no more to-day!
34   We will sing one song
35   For the old Kentucky Home,
36   For the old Kentucky Home, far away.

"Men know but little more than we,
Who count us least of things terrene,
How happy days are made to be!
"Of such strange tidings what think ye,
O birds in brown that peck and preen?
Men know but little more than we!
"When I was borne from yonder tree
In bonds to them, I hoped to glean
How happy days are made to be,
"And want and wailing turned to glee;
Alas, despite their mighty mien
Men know but little more than we!
"They cannot change the Frost's decree,
They cannot keep the skies serene;
How happy days are made to be
"Eludes great Man's sagacity
No less than ours, O tribes in treen!
Men know but little more than we
How happy days are made to be."

Close on the margin of a brawling brook
That bathes the low dell's bosom, stands a Cot;
O'ershadow'd by broad Alders. At its door
A rude seat, with an ozier canopy
Invites the weary traveller to rest.
'Tis a poor humble dwelling; yet within,
The sweets of joy domestic, oft have made
The long hour not unchearly, while the Moor
Was covered with deep snow, and the bleak blast
Swept with impetuous wing the mountain's brow!
On ev'ry tree of the near shelt'ring wood
The minstrelsy of Nature, shrill and wild,
Welcomes the stranger guest, and carolling
Love-songs, spontaneous, greets him merrily.
The distant hills, empurpled by the dawn
And thinly scatter'd with blue mists that float
On their bleak summits dimly visible,
Skirt the domain luxuriant, while the air
Breathes healthful fragrance. On the Cottage roof
The gadding Ivy, and the tawny Vine
Bind the brown thatch, the shelter'd winter-hut
Of the tame Sparrow, and the Red-breast bold.
There dwells the Soldier's Widow! young and fair
Yet not more fair than virtuous. Every day
She wastes the hour-glass, waiting his return,--
And every hour anticipates the day,
(Deceiv'd, yet cherish'd by the flatt'rer hope)
When she shall meet her Hero. On the Eve
Of Sabbath rest, she trims her little hut
With blossoms, fresh and gaudy, still, herself
The queen-flow'r of the garland ! The sweet Rose
Of wood-wild beauty, blushing thro' her tears.
One little Son she has, a lusty Boy,
The darling of her guiltless, mourning heart,
The only dear and gay associate
Of her lone widowhood. His sun-burnt cheek
Is never blanch'd with fear, though he will climb
The broad oak's branches, and with brawny arm
Sever the limpid wave. In his blue eye
Beams all his mother's gentleness of soul;
While his brave father's warm intrepid heart
Throbs in his infant bosom. 'Tis a wight
Most valourous, yet pliant as the stem
Of the low vale-born lily, when the dew
Presses its perfum'd head. Eight years his voice
Has chear'd the homely hut, for he could lisp
Soft words of filial fondness, ere his feet
Could measure the smooth path-way.
On the hills
He watches the wide waste of wavy green
Tissued with orient lustre, till his eyes
Ache with the dazzling splendour, and the main,
Rolling and blazing, seems a second Sun !
And, if a distant whitening sail appears,
Skimming the bright horizon while the mast
Is canopied with clouds of dappled gold,
He homeward hastes rejoicing. An old Tree
Is his lone watch-tow'r; 'tis a blasted Oak
Which, from a vagrant Acorn, ages past,
Sprang up, to triumph like a Savage bold
Braving the Season's warfare. There he sits
Silent and musing the long Evening hour,
'Till the short reign of Sunny splendour fades
At the cold touch of twilight. Oft he sings;
Or from his oaten pipe, untiring pours
The tune mellifluous which his father sung,
When HE could only listen.
On the sands
That bind the level sea-shore, will he stray,
When morn unlocks the East, and flings afar
The rosy day-beam ! There the boy will stop
To gather the dank weeds which ocean leaves
On the bleak strand, while winter o'er the main
Howls its nocturnal clamour. There again
He chaunts his Father's ditty. Never more
Poor mountain minstrel, shall thy bosom throb
To the sweet cadence ! never more thy tear
Fall as the dulcet breathings give each word
Expression magical ! Thy Father, Boy,
Sleeps on the bed of death ! His tongue is mute,
His fingers have forgot their pliant art,
His oaten pipe will ne'er again be heard
Echoing along the valley ! Never more
Will thy fond mother meet the balmy smile
Of peace domestic, or the circling arm
Of valour, temper'd by the milder joys
Of rural merriment. His very name
Is now forgotten! for no trophied tomb
Tells of his bold exploits; such heraldry
Befits not humble worth: For pomp and praise
Wait in the gilded palaces of Pride
To dress Ambition's Slaves. Yet, on his grave,
The unmark'd resting place of Valour's Sons,
The morning beam shines lust'rous; The meek flow'r
Still drops the twilight tear, and the night breeze
Moans melancholy music!
Then, to ME,
O ! dearer far is the poor Soldier's grave,
The Widow's lone and unregarded Cot,
The brawling Brook, and the wide Alder-bough,
The ozier Canopy, and plumy choir,
Hymning the Morn's return, than the rich Dome
Of gilded Palaces ! and sweeter far--
O! far more graceful ! far more exquisite,
The Widow's tear bathing the living rose,
Than the rich ruby, blushing on the breast,
Of guilty greatness. Welcome then to me--
The WIDOW'S LOWLY HOME : The Soldier's HEIR;
The proud inheritor of Heav'n's best gifts--
The mind unshackled--and the guiltless Soul!

Sing, O Muse, in treble clef,
A little song of the A.E.F.,
And pardon me, please, if I give vent
To something akin to sentiment.
But we have our moments Over Here
When we want to cry and we want to cheer;
And the hurrah feeling will not down
When you meet a man from your own home town.
It's many a lonesome, longsome day
Since you embarked from the U.S.A.,
And you met some men--it's a great big war--
From towns that you never had known before;
And you landed here, and your rest camp mate
Was a man from some strange and distant state.
Liked him? Yes; but you wanted to see
A man from the town where you used to be.
And then you went, by design or chance,
All over the well-known map of France;
And you yearned with a yearn that grew and grew
To talk with a man from the burg you knew.
And some lugubrious morn when
Your morale is batting about .110,
"Where are you from?" and you make reply,
And the O.D. warrior says, "So am I."
The universe wears a smiling face
As you spill your talk of the old home place;
You talk of the streets, and the home town jokes,
And you find that you know each other's folks;
And you haven't any more woes at all
Ad you both decide that the world is small--
A statement adding to its renown
When you meet a man from your own home town.
You may be among the enlisted men,
You may be a Lieut. or a Major-Gen.;
Your home may be up in the Chilkoot Pass,
In Denver, Col., or in Pittsfield, Mass.;
You may have come from Chicago, Ill.,
Buffalo, Portland, or Louisville--
But there's nothing, I'm gambling, can keep you down,
When you meet a man from your own home town.
* * * * *
If you want to know why I wrote this pome,
Well . . . I've just had a talk with a guy from home.

Dare I hope to hope?
Is it safe? Is it right?
Am I hoping for nothing
But a black and empty night?
Hope should make me happy.
I should laugh, sing, and dance
Because I am hoping. Right?
Ha! Not a chance.
How is it that hope can leave me
Trembling in the darkness?
How is it that something so “good”
Should leave me feeling helpless?
Dare I hope to hope?
What difference does it make?
Fate will be fate in the end,
It will either “make or break.”
Does Fate regard my hope?
Does She listen? Or care?
Am I shooting for a star that
Simply isn’t there?
I cannot know! Oh, God
Why must I struggle with
This doubt that pulls at me
Rends me, limb from limb?
What sort of hope leaves pain
Where it should instead leave joy?
Is this hope at all? Or perhaps
Some wicked demon’s ploy?
I cannot know! Dear heaven!
How can I even begin to dare
To hope for something – anything?
Is no assurance there?
No promise? No guarantee?
I cannot stand it! I cannot!
The doubt is a plague
In my every thought.
Dare I hope to hope
In a hope that leaves me dry
And lost? How can I dare
To hope in hope? How can I?

Strong are thine arms, O love, & strong
Thine heart to live, and love, and long;
But thou art wed to grief and wrong:
Live, then, and long, though hope be dead!
Live on, & labour thro’ the years!
Make pictures through the mist of tears,
Of unforgotten happy fears,
That crossed the time ere hope was dead.
Draw near the place where once we stood
Amid delight’s swift-rushing flood,
And we and all the world seemed good
Nor needed hope now cold and dead.
Dream in the dawn I come to thee
Weeping for things that may not be!
Dream that thou layest lips on me!
Wake, wake to clasp hope’s body dead!
Count o’er and o’er, and one by one
The minutes of the happy sun
That while agone on kissed lips shone,
Count on, rest not, for hope is dead.
Weep, though no hair’s breadth thou shalt move
The living Earth, the heaven above
By all the bitterness of love!
Weep and cease not, now hope is dead!
Sighs rest thee not, tears bring no ease,
Life hath no joy, and Death no peace:
The years change not, though they decrease,
For hope is dead, for hope is dead.
Speak, love, I listen: far away
I bless the tremulous lips, that say,
“Mock not the afternoon of day,
Mock not the tide when hope is dead!”
I bless thee, O my love, who say’st:
“Mock not the thistle-cumbered waste;
I hold Love’s hand, and make no haste
Down the long way, now hope is dead.
With other names do we name pain,
The long years wear our hearts in vain.
Mock not our loss grown into gain,
Mock not our lost hope lying dead.
Our eyes gaze for no morning-star,
No glimmer of the dawn afar;
Full silent wayfarers we are
Since ere the noon-tide hope lay dead.
Behold with lack of happiness
The master, Love, our hearts did bless
Lest we should think of him the less:
Love dieth not, though hope is dead!”

'Hope' is the thing with feathers—
That perches in the soul—
And sings the tune without the words—
And never stops—at all—
And sweetest—in the Gale—is heard—
And sore must be the storm—
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm—
I've heard it in the chillest land—
And on the strangest Sea—
Yet, never, in Extremity,
It asked a crumb—of Me.

What is hope, ask a bee in cold winter days,
she hangs around the pruned rose bushes,
with the hope that someday the spring will come,
and the flowers will bloom again in the garden.
What is hope, ask the blue bird pair in early spring,
they work diligently to bring every twig and grass,
to build their nest in the corner nook of my house,
I see the hope in the eyes of this lovely pair,
They are dreaming of a happy home for their family.
What is hope,  ask a lonesome soul,
When the uncertainties linger around in mind,
hope is the only refuge to calm our fears,
When the loneliness sends one in depression,
the hope of a companionship overshadows the despair.
What is hope, ask a human being,
our life is a sand castle of hope on a sandy beach,
with the lingering fear of drowning in occasional high tide,
our destiny, our future, and our own survival,
hangs around the magical hope, the hope that is the eternal inspiration.

Hope swirls around the little boy's head
Jumping on the bed Christmas morning
Giddy and laughing
Hope carries him on fairy wings
Down the stairs to the den at six a.m.
And giggles as he whispers
"You know it's gonna be there."
Hope fills his eyes with wonder
As he surveys the packages
As he selects the first one
As he tears through
The paper
And the ribbon
And the tissue
Hope squeals with eagerness
And tells the little boy that he
Will find his new train
And when the little boy finds
A sweater instead
Hope never lets up
"Just open the next one,
You know it's gonna be there."
And he surveys the packages
And he selects the next one
And he tears through
The paper
And the ribbon
And the tissue
Hope reassures with kindness
And tells the little boy that this time he
Will find his new train
And when the little boy finds
A book instead
Hope never lets up
"Just open the next one,
You know it's gonna be there."
An on and on it goes
Until there are no packages left
And the floor is littered with
Empty boxes
And hope never says another word
While he sneaks out the window
Smiling from ear to ear
Leaving the little boy alone to answer
The knock at the door
Hope swirls around the young man's head
Before sitting in the seat beside him
Giddy and laughing
Hope carries him on fiery hooves
Down the road to the party at eight p.m.
And giggles as he whispers
"You know they're gonna be there."
Hope fills his eyes with wonder
As he surveys the room
As he greets the first one
As he tears through
The awkwardness
And the doubt
And the tension
Hope squeals with eagerness
And tells the young man that he
Will find his new friends
And when the young man finds
A closed society instead
Hope never lets up
"Just greet the next one,
You know they're gonna be there."
And he surveys the room
And he greets the next one
And he tears through
The awkwardness
And the doubt
And the tension
Hope reassures with kindness
And tells the young man that this time he
Will find his new friends
And when the young man finds
Indifference instead
Hope never lets up
"Just greet the next one,
You know they're gonna be there."
An on and on it goes
Until there are no people left
And the floor is littered with
Empty bottles and cans
And hope never says another word
While he sneaks out the window
Smiling from ear to ear
Leaving the young man alone to answer
The knock at the door
Hope swirls around the husband's head
Lying in the bed beside him
Giddy and laughing
Hope carries him on a magic carpet
Across the gap in the bed to the arms of his wife at ten p.m.
And giggles as he whispers
"You know she's gonna be there."
Hope fills his eyes with wonder
As he surveys her face
As he reaches to touch
As he tears through
The guilt
And the anger
And the apprehension
Hope squeals with eagerness
And tells the husband that he
Will find his comfort and love
And when he finds
Rejection instead
Hope never lets up
"Just reach out again,
You know she's gonna be there."
And he surveys her face
And he reaches to touch
And he tears through
The guilt
And the anger
And the apprehension
Hope reassures with kindness
And tells the husband that this time he
Will find his comfort and love
And when the husband finds
Cruelty instead
Hope never lets up
"Just reach out again,
You know she's gonna be there."
An on and on it goes
Until there are no people left
And the floor is littered with
Years and distant memories
And hope never says another word
While he sneaks out the window
Smiling from ear to ear
Leaving the husband alone to answer
The knock at the door
Hope swirls around the son's head
Walking arm and arm down the cold sanitary corridor
Warm and caring
Hope carries him on angel's wings
Down the hall to the semi-private room
And reassures as he whispers
"You know he's gonna be OK."
Hope fills his eyes with wonder
As he surveys the bed and the wheelchair
As he selects his first words
As he tears through
The jargon
And the reports
And the sadness
Hope squeals with eagerness
And tells the son that he
Will find his father well
And when the son finds
Illness instead
Hope never lets up
"Just come another day,
You know he's gonna be OK."
And he surveys the bed and the wheelchair
And he selects the next one
And he tears through
The jargon
And the reports
Hope reassures with kindness
And tells the son that this time he
Will find his father well
And when the son finds
A stroke instead
Hope never lets up
"Just come one more time,
You know he's gonna be OK."
An on and on it goes
Until there is no life left
And the floor is littered with
Tissues and rubber gloves
And hope never says another word
While he sneaks out the window
Smiling from ear to ear
Leaving the son alone to answer
The knock at the door
And the little boy
And the young man
And the husband
And the son
Go to the door
Looking to see if hope has come back
And pain walks in
And pain doesn't swirl
And pain doesn't giggle
And pain doesn't jump on the bed
And pain doesn't hold his hand
With giddy excitement or warm assurances
Pain just makes his intentions known
And tells them to wake up
There never was a train
And the friends would only let you down
And love is conditional
And your Father is dying
And after making his announcements
Pain doesn't sneak through the window
Grinning from ear to ear
He walks into the kitchen and
Makes a sandwich
And says, "You should get to know me.
I'm gonna be here for a while."
And pain doesn't whisper
And pain doesn't tempt them
To keep looking, and greeting and reaching out
He just sits there eating his sandwich
And asking for a glass of milk
And perhaps a cookie
If it's not too much trouble
And pain doesn't carry them
Anywhere on anything
He just follows them around
Never more than a few paces back
And pain reminds them
That he's gonna be there
When they wake up
And when they go to sleep
And if they want him to leave
They're gonna have to ask him to go
And they better mean it
Because if they don't
He'll be back
And he'll knock on that door
As soon as hope sneaks out
The window

Grey street corner
A frozen room
Lonely bed
A dying moon
Litter swept streets
And templed stars
Blurred rising sun
Hits burnt out cars.
Hate scrawled text
On bricked in walls
From cancered branch
A last leaf falls
The knife drawn streets
Barred with shops,
The downward wound
That never stops.
A Frostbitten tree
A pock marked road.
First morning truck
With a heavy load.
Gun ruled streets
Of bricks and knives
Discarded dreams
And shattered lives.
A world of pain
A world of snow
Nowhere to leave
No place to go
With no hope
To a world forlorn
No route to life
A child is born

A girl of beauty, shy and innocent!
She liked to stay aloof in her own world;
She read a lot of books while in convent:
Stood first in school in every exam held!
She had few friends and stayed away from boys!
Her dress was neat although simple and cheap!
She sang some songs alone in high-pitched voice;
She prayed a lot and in her heart did weep?
My elder sister, lovely, sweet and nice,
She joined Health Service as a Government Doc;
'One blunder in her life proved her unwise! '
She serves the sick and poor by hearty talk!
Did God ignore her desires in life?
Lord, save her soul and keep her safe ’midst strife!

There was this hope
In one man's dream:
With all his heart,
Therein it seems...
Of memories gone
Of love and care,
For years go on
Those are so dear.
I felt it too
In dreams of mine,
Just like in yours,
They well on did shine.
And sometimes I found,
When I walked alone:
They kept me bound,
Though they had flown.
For life is a touch
Of those hidden things,
That we love so much
And to us again sings.

The neighbors' dog will not stop barking.
He is barking the same high, rhythmic bark
that he barks every time they leave the house.
They must switch him on on their way out.
The neighbors' dog will not stop barking.
I close all the windows in the house
and put on a Beethoven symphony full blast
but I can still hear him muffled under the music,
barking, barking, barking,
and now I can see him sitting in the orchestra,
his head raised confidently as if Beethoven
had included a part for barking dog.
When the record finally ends he is still barking,
sitting there in the oboe section barking,
his eyes fixed on the conductor who is
entreating him with his baton
while the other musicians listen in respectful
silence to the famous barking dog solo,
that endless coda that first established
Beethoven as an innovative genius.

I love to go to Grampa's house.
He lives far, far away.
It's hard to sit still in the car
and it takes us two whole days.
My Grampa's fun is different.
He doesn't run and play.
But grampa's fun is special fun
and I love him best that way.
My Grampa tells me stories
when I sit on his knee
about the games and things he did
when he was small like me.
Sometimes he takes me fishin'
in a boat out on the lake.
We sing songs and then I giggle
at the bird sounds Grampa makes.
My grampa knows the names of things
like trees and plants and such.
He shares the stuff he knows with me
and I love him, oh so much.
I wish Grampa lived next door to me.
he lives so far away...
But I love to go to Grampa's house
though it takes us two whole days.

I went to Love's old treasure house last night,
Alone, when all the world was still -- asleep,
And saw the miser Memory, grown gray
With years of jealous counting of his gems,
There seated. Keen was his eye, his hand
Firm as when first his hoarding he began
Of precious things of Love, long years ago.
"And this," he said, "is gold from out her hair,
And this the moonlight that she wandered in,
With here a rose, enamelled by her breath,
That bloomed in glory 'tween her breasts, and here
The brimming sun-cup that she quaffed at noon,
And here the star that cheered her in the night;
In this great chest, see curiously wrought,
Are purest of Love's gems." A ruby key,
Enclasped upon a golden ring, he took,
With care, from out some secret hiding-place,
And delicately touched the lock, whereat
I staggered, blinded by the light of things
More luminous than stars, and questioned thus --
"What are these treasures, miser Memory?"
And slowly bending his gray head, he spoke:
"These are the multitudes of kisses sweet
Love gave so gladly, and I treasure here."

Life and Thought have gone away
Side by side,
Leaving door and windows wide.
Careless tenants they!
All within is dark as night:
In the windows is no light;
And no murmur at the door,
So frequent on its hinge before.
Close the door; the shutters close;
Or through the windows we shall see
The nakedness and vacancy
Of the dark deserted house.
Come away: no more of mirth
Is here or merry-making sound.
The house was builded of the earth,
And shall fall again to ground.
Come away: for Life and Thought
Here no longer dwell;
But in a city glorious -
A great and distant city -have bought
A mansion incorruptible.
Would they could have stayed with us!

The snow floats down upon us, mingled with rain...
It eddies around pale lilac lamps, and falls
Down golden-windowed walls.
We were all born of flesh, in a flare of pain,
We do not remember the red roots whence we rose,
But we know that we rose and walked, that after a while
We shall lie down again.
The snow floats down upon us, we turn, we turn,
Through gorges filled with light we sound and flow...
One is struck down and hurt, we crowd about him,
We bear him away, gaze after his listless body;
But whether he lives or dies we do not know.
One of us sings in the street, and we listen to him;
The words ring over us like vague bells of sorrow.
He sings of a house he lived in long ago.
It is strange; this house of dust was the house I lived in;
The house you lived in, the house that all of us know.
And coiling slowly about him, and laughing at him,
And throwing him pennies, we bear away
A mournful echo of other times and places,
And follow a dream... a dream that will not stay.
Down long broad flights of lamplit stairs we flow;
Noisy, in scattered waves, crowding and shouting;
In broken slow cascades.
The gardens extend before us...  We spread out swiftly;
Trees are above us, and darkness.  The canyon fades...
And we recall, with a gleaming stab of sadness,
Vaguely and incoherently, some dream
Of a world we came from, a world of sun-blue hills...
A black wood whispers around us, green eyes gleam;
Someone cries in the forest, and someone kills.
We flow to the east, to the white-lined shivering sea;
We reach to the west, where the whirling sun went down;
We close our eyes to music in bright cafes.
We diverge from clamorous streets to streets that are silent.
We loaf where the wind-spilled fountain plays.
And, growing tired, we turn aside at last,
Remember our secret selves, seek out our towers,
Lay weary hands on the banisters, and climb;
Climbing, each, to his little four-square dream
Of love or lust or beauty or death or crime.

'Number four—the girl who died on the table—
The girl with golden hair—'
The purpling body lies on the polished marble.
We open the throat, and lay the thyroid bare . . .
One, who held the ether-cone, remembers
Her dark blue frightened eyes.
He heard the sharp breath quiver, and saw her breast
More hurriedly fall and rise.
Her hands made futile gestures, she turned her head
Fighting for breath; her cheeks were flushed to scarlet,—
And, suddenly, she lay dead.
And all the dreams that hurried along her veins
Came to the darkness of a sudden wall.
Confusion ran among them, they whirled and clamored,
They fell, they rose, they struck, they shouted,
Till at last a pallor of silence hushed them all.
What was her name?  Where had she walked that morning?
Through what dark forest came her feet?
Along what sunlit walls, what peopled street?
Backward he dreamed along a chain of days,
He saw her go her strange and secret ways,
Waking and sleeping, noon and night.
She sat by a mirror, braiding her golden hair.
She read a story by candlelight.
Her shadow ran before her along the street,
She walked with rhythmic feet,
Turned a corner, descended a stair.
She bought a paper, held it to scan the headlines,
Smiled for a moment at sea-gulls high in sunlight,
And drew deep breaths of air.
Days passed, bright clouds of days.  Nights passed. And music
Murmured within the walls of lighted windows.
She lifted her face to the light and danced.
The dancers wreathed and grouped in moving patterns,
Clustered, receded, streamed, advanced.
Her dress was purple, her slippers were golden,
Her eyes were blue; and a purple orchid
Opened its golden heart on her breast . . .
She leaned to the surly languor of lazy music,
Leaned on her partner's arm to rest.
The violins were weaving a weft of silver,
The horns were weaving a lustrous brede of gold,
And time was caught in a glistening pattern,
Time, too elusive to hold . . .
Shadows of leaves fell over her face,—and sunlight:
She turned her face away.
Nearer she moved to a crouching darkness
With every step and day.
Death, who at first had thought of her only an instant,
At a great distance, across the night,
Smiled from a window upon her, and followed her slowly
From purple light to light.
Once, in her dreams, he spoke out clearly, crying,
'I am the murderer, death.
I am the lover who keeps his appointment
At the doors of breath!'
She rose and stared at her own reflection,
Half dreading there to find
The dark-eyed ghost, waiting beside her,
Or reaching from behind
To lay pale hands upon her shoulders . . .
Or was this in her mind? . . .
She combed her hair.  The sunlight glimmered
Along the tossing strands.
Was there a stillness in this hair,—
A quiet in these hands?
Death was a dream.  It could not change these eyes,
Blow out their light, or turn this mouth to dust.
She combed her hair and sang.  She would live forever.
Leaves flew past her window along a gust . . .
And graves were dug in the earth, and coffins passed,
And music ebbed with the ebbing hours.
And dreams went along her veins, and scattering clouds
Threw streaming shadows on walls and towers.

Now, when the moon slid under the cloud
And the cold clear dark of starlight fell,
He heard in his blood the well-known bell
Tolling slowly in heaves of sound,
Slowly beating, slowly beating,
Shaking its pulse on the stagnant air:
Sometimes it swung completely round,
Horribly gasping as if for breath;
Falling down with an anguished cry . . .
Now the red bat, he mused, will fly;
Something is marked, this night, for death . . .
And while he mused, along his blood
Flew ghostly voices, remote and thin,
They rose in the cavern of his brain,
Like ghosts they died away again;
And hands upon his heart were laid,
And music upon his flesh was played,
Until, as he was bidden to do,
He walked the wood he so well knew.
Through the cold dew he moved his feet,
And heard far off, as under the earth,
Discordant music in shuddering tones,
Screams of laughter, horrible mirth,
Clapping of hands, and thudding of drums,
And the long-drawn wail of one in pain.
To-night, he thought, I shall die again,
We shall die again in the red-eyed fire
To meet on the edge of the wood beyond
With the placid gaze of fed desire . . .
He walked; and behind the whisper of trees,
In and out, one walked with him:
She parted the branches and peered at him,
Through lowered lids her two eyes burned,
He heard her breath, he saw her hand,
Wherever he turned his way, she turned:
Kept pace with him, now fast, now slow;
Moving her white knees as he moved . . .
This is the one I have always loved;
This is the one whose bat-soul comes
To dance with me, flesh to flesh,
In the starlight dance of horns and drums . . .
The walls and roofs, the scarlet towers,
Sank down behind a rushing sky.
He heard a sweet song just begun
Abruptly shatter in tones and die.
It whirled away.  Cold silence fell.
And again came tollings of a bell.
*     *     *     *     *
This air is alive with witches: the white witch rides
Swifter than smoke on the starlit wind.
In the clear darkness, while the moon hides,
They come like dreams, like something remembered . .
Let us hurry! beloved; take my hand,
Forget these things that trouble your eyes,
Forget, forget!  Our flesh is changed,
Lighter than smoke we wreathe and rise . . .
The cold air hisses between us . . . Beloved, beloved,
What was the word you said?
Something about clear music that sang through water . . .
I cannot remember.  The storm-drops break on the leaves.
Something was lost in the darkness.  Someone is dead.
Someone lies in the garden and grieves.
Look how the branches are tossed in this air,
Flinging their green to the earth!
Black clouds rush to devour the stars in the sky,
The moon stares down like a half-closed eye.
The leaves are scattered, the birds are blown,
Oaks crash down in the darkness,
We run from our windy shadows; we are running alone.
*     *     *     *     *
The moon was darkened: across it flew
The swift grey tenebrous shape he knew,
Like a thing of smoke it crossed the sky,
The witch! he said.  And he heard a cry,
And another came, and another came,
And one, grown duskily red with blood,
Floated an instant across the moon,
Hung like a dull fantastic flame . . .
The earth has veins: they throb to-night,
The earth swells warm beneath my feet,
The tips of the trees grow red and bright,
The leaves are swollen, I feel them beat,
They press together, they push and sigh,
They listen to hear the great bat cry,
The great red bat with the woman's face . . .
Hurry! he said.  And pace for pace
That other, who trod the dark with him,
Crushed the live leaves, reached out white hands
And closed her eyes, the better to see
The priests with claws, the lovers with hooves,
The fire-lit rock, the sarabands.
I am here! she said.  The bough he broke—
Was it the snapping bough that spoke?
I am here! she said.  The white thigh gleamed
Cold in starlight among dark leaves,
The head thrown backward as he had dreamed,
The shadowy red deep jasper mouth;
And the lifted hands, and the virgin breasts,
Passed beside him, and vanished away.
I am here! she cried.  He answered 'Stay!'
And laughter arose, and near and far
Answering laughter rose and died . . .
Who is there? in the dark? he cried.
He stood in terror, and heard a sound
Of terrible hooves on the hollow ground;
They rushed, were still; a silence fell;
And he heard deep tollings of a bell.
*     *     *     *     *
Look beloved!  Why do you hide your face?
Look, in the centre there, above the fire,
They are bearing the boy who blasphemed love!
They are playing a piercing music upon him
With a bow of living wire! . . .
The virgin harlot sings,
She leans above the beautiful anguished body,
And draws slow music from those strings.
They dance around him, they fling red roses upon him,
They trample him with their naked feet,
His cries are lost in laughter,
Their feet grow dark with his blood, they beat and
beat,
They dance upon him, until he cries no more . . .
Have we not heard that cry before?
Somewhere, somewhere,
Beside a sea, in the green evening,
Beneath green clouds, in a copper sky . . .
Was it you? was it I?
They have quenched the fires, they dance in the darkness,
The satyrs have run among them to seize and tear,
Look! he has caught one by the hair,
She screams and falls, he bears her away with him,
And the night grows full of whistling wings.
Far off, one voice, serene and sweet,
Rises and sings . . .
'By the clear waters where once I died,
In the calm evening bright with stars. . . .'
Where have I heard these words?  Was it you who sang them?
It was long ago.
Let us hurry, beloved! the hard hooves trample;
The treetops tremble and glow.
*     *     *     *     *
In the clear dark, on silent wings,
The red bat hovers beneath her moon;
She drops through the fragrant night, and clings
Fast in the shadow, with hands like claws,
With soft eyes closed and mouth that feeds,
To the young white flesh that warmly bleeds.
The maidens circle in dance, and raise
From lifting throats, a soft-sung praise;
Their knees and breasts are white and bare,
They have hung pale roses in their hair,
Each of them as she dances by
Peers at the blood with a narrowed eye.
See how the red wing wraps him round,
See how the white youth struggles in vain!
The weak arms writhe in a soundless pain;
He writhes in the soft red veiny wings,
But still she whispers upon him and clings. . . .
This is the secret feast of love,
Look well, look well, before it dies,
See how the red one trembles above,
See how quiet the white one lies! . . . .
Wind through the trees. . . .and a voice is heard
Singing far off.  The dead leaves fall. . . .
'By the clear waters where once I died,
In the calm evening bright with stars,
One among numberless avatars,
I wedded a mortal, a mortal bride,
And lay on the stones and gave my flesh,
And entered the hunger of him I loved.
How shall I ever escape this mesh
Or be from my lover's body removed?'
Dead leaves stream through the hurrying air
And the maenads dance with flying hair.
*     *     *     *     *
The priests with hooves, the lovers with horns,
Rise in the starlight, one by one,
They draw their knives on the spurting throats,
They smear the column with blood of goats,
They dabble the blood on hair and lips
And wait like stones for the moon's eclipse.
They stand like stones and stare at the sky
Where the moon leers down like a half-closed eye. . .
In the green moonlight still they stand
While wind flows over the darkened sand
And brood on the soft forgotten things
That filled their shadowy yesterdays. . . .
Where are the breasts, the scarlet wings? . . . .
They gaze at each other with troubled gaze. . . .
And then, as the shadow closes the moon,
Shout, and strike with their hooves the ground,
And rush through the dark, and fill the night
With a slowly dying clamor of sound.
There, where the great walls crowd the stars,
There, by the black wind-riven walls,
In a grove of twisted leafless trees. . . .
Who are these pilgrims, who are these,
These three, the one of whom stands upright,
While one lies weeping and one of them crawls?
The face that he turned was a wounded face,
I heard the dripping of blood on stones. . . .
Hooves had trampled and torn this place,
And the leaves were strewn with blood and bones.
Sometimes, I think, beneath my feet,
The warm earth stretches herself and sighs. . . .
Listen!  I heard the slow heart beat. . . .
I will lie on this grass as a lover lies
And reach to the north and reach to the south
And seek in the darkness for her mouth.
*     *     *     *     *
Beloved, beloved, where the slow waves of the wind
Shatter pale foam among great trees,
Under the hurrying stars, under the heaving arches,
Like one whirled down under shadowy seas,
I run to find you, I run and cry,
Where are you?  Where are you?  It is I.  It is I.
It is your eyes I seek, it is your windy hair,
Your starlight body that breathes in the darkness there.
Under the darkness I feel you stirring. . . .
Is this you?  Is this you?
Bats in this air go whirring. . . .
And this soft mouth that darkly meets my mouth,
Is this the soft mouth I knew?
Darkness, and wind in the tortured trees;
And the patter of dew.
*     *     *     *     *
Dance!  Dance!  Dance!  Dance!
Dance till the brain is red with speed!
Dance till you fall!  Lift your torches!
Kiss your lovers until they bleed!
Backward I draw your anguished hair
Until your eyes are stretched with pain;
Backward I press you until you cry,
Your lips grow white, I kiss you again,
I will take a torch and set you afire,
I will break your body and fling it away. . . .
Look, you are trembling. . . .Lie still, beloved!
Lock your hands in my hair, and say
Darling! darling! darling! darling!
All night long till the break of day.
Is it your heart I hear beneath me. . . .
Or the far tolling of that tower?
The voices are still that cried around us. . . .
The woods grow still for the sacred hour.
Rise, white lover! the day draws near.
The grey trees lean to the east in fear.
'By the clear waters where once I died . . . .'
Beloved, whose voice was this that cried?
'By the clear waters that reach the sun
By the clear waves that starward run. . . .
I found love's body and lost his soul,
And crumbled in flame that should have annealed. . .
How shall I ever again be whole,
By what dark waters shall I be healed?'
Silence. . . .the red leaves, one by one,
Fall.  Far off, the maenads run.
Silence.  Beneath my naked feet
The veins of the red earth swell and beat.
The dead leaves sigh on the troubled air,
Far off the maenads bind their hair. . . .
Hurry, beloved! the day comes soon.
The fire is drawn from the heart of the moon.
*     *     *     *     *
The great bell cracks and falls at last.
The moon whirls out.  The sky grows still.
Look, how the white cloud crosses the stars
And suddenly drops behind the hill!
Your eyes are placid, you smile at me,
We sit in the room by candle-light.
We peer in each other's veins and see
No sign of the things we saw this night.
Only, a song is in your ears,
A song you have heard, you think, in dream:
The song which only the demon hears,
In the dark forest where maenads scream . . .
'By the clear waters where once I died . . .
In the calm evening bright with stars . . . '
What do the strange words mean? you say,—
And touch my hand, and turn away.

The house was quiet and the world was calm.
The reader became the book; and summer night
Was like the conscious being of the book.
The house was quiet and the world was calm.
The words were spoken as if there was no book,
Except that the reader leaned above the page,
Wanted to lean, wanted much to be
The scholar to whom his book is true, to whom
The summer night is like a perfection of thought.
The house was quiet because it had to be.
The quiet was part of the meaning, part of the mind:
The access of perfection to the page.
And the world was calm. The truth in a calm world,
In which there is no other meaning, itself
Is calm, itself is summer and night, itself
Is the reader leaning late and reading there.

Within this sober Frame expect
Work of no Forrain Architect;
That unto Caves the Quarries drew,
And Forrests did to Pastures hew;
Who of his great Design in pain
Did for a Model vault his Brain,
Whose Columnes should so high be rais'd
To arch the Brows that on them gaz'd.
Why should of all things Man unrul'd
Such unproportion'd dwellings build?
The Beasts are by their Denns exprest:
And Birds contrive an equal Nest;
The low roof'd Tortoises do dwell
In cases fit of Tortoise-shell:
No Creature loves an empty space;
Their Bodies measure out their Place.
But He, superfluously spread,
Demands more room alive then dead.
And in his hollow Palace goes
Where Winds as he themselves may lose.
What need of all this Marble Crust
T'impark the wanton Mose of Dust,
That thinks by Breadth the World t'unite
Though the first Builders fail'd in Height?
But all things are composed here
Like Nature, orderly and near:
In which we the Dimensions find
Of that more sober Age and Mind,
When larger sized Men did stoop
To enter at a narrow loop;
As practising, in doors so strait,
To strain themselves through Heavens Gate.
And surely when the after Age
Shall hither come in Pilgrimage,
These sacred Places to adore,
By Vere and Fairfax trod before,
Men will dispute how their Extent
Within such dwarfish Confines went:
And some will smile at this, as well
As Romulus his Bee-like Cell.
Humility alone designs
Those short but admirable Lines,
By which, ungirt and unconstrain'd,
Things greater are in less contain'd.
Let others vainly strive t'immure
The Circle in the Quadrature!
These holy Mathematics can
In ev'ry Figure equal Man.
Yet thus the laden House does sweat,
And scarce indures the Master great:
But where he comes the swelling Hall
Stirs, and the Square grows Spherical;
More by his Magnitude distrest,
Then he is by its straitness prest:
And too officiously it slights
That in it self which him delights.
So Honour better Lowness bears,
Then That unwonted Greatness wears
Height with a certain Grace does bend,
But low Things clownishly ascend.
And yet what needs there here Excuse,
Where ev'ry Thing does answer Use?
Where neatness nothing can condemn,
Nor Pride invent what to contemn?
A Stately Frontispice Of Poor
Adorns without the open Door:
Nor less the Rooms within commends
Daily new Furniture Of Friends.
The House was built upon the Place
Only as for a Mark Of Grace;
And for an Inn to entertain
Its Lord a while, but not remain.
Him Bishops-Hill, or Denton may,
Or Bilbrough, better hold then they:
But Nature here hath been so free
As if she said leave this to me.
Art would more neatly have defac'd
What she had laid so sweetly wast;
In fragrant Gardens, shaddy Woods,
Deep Meadows, and transparent Floods.
While with slow Eyes we these survey,
And on each pleasant footstep stay,
We opportunly may relate
The progress of this Houses Fate.
A Nunnery first gave it birth.
For Virgin Buildings oft brought forth.
And all that Neighbour-Ruine shows
The Quarries whence this dwelling rose.
Near to this gloomy Cloysters Gates
There dwelt the blooming Virgin Thwates,
Fair beyond Measure, and an Heir
Which might Deformity make fair.
And oft She spent the Summer Suns
Discoursing with the Suttle Nuns.
Whence in these Words one to her weav'd,
(As 'twere by Chance) Thoughts long conceiv'd.
"Within this holy leisure we
"Live innocently as you see.
"these Walls restrain the World without,
"But hedge our Liberty about.
"These Bars inclose the wider Den
"Of those wild Creatures, called Men.
"The Cloyster outward shuts its Gates,
"And, from us, locks on them the Grates.
"Here we, in shining Armour white,
"Like Virgin Amazons do fight.
"And our chast Lamps we hourly trim,
"Lest the great Bridegroom find them dim.
"Our Orient Breaths perfumed are
"With insense of incessant Pray'r.
"And Holy-water of our Tears
"Most strangly our complexion clears.
"Not Tears of Grief; but such as those
"With which calm Pleasure overflows;
"Or Pity, when we look on you
"That live without this happy Vow.
"How should we grieve that must be seen
"Each one a Spouse, and each a Queen;
"And can in Heaven hence behold
"Our brighter Robes and Crowns of Gold?
"When we have prayed all our Beads,
"Some One the holy Legend reads;
"While all the rest with Needles paint
"The Face and Graces of the Saint.
"But what the Linnen can't receive
"They in their Lives do interweave
"This work the Saints best represents;
"That serves for Altar's Ornaments.
"But much it to our work would add
"If here your hand, your Face we had:
"By it we would our Lady touch;
"Yet thus She you resembles much.
"Some of your Features, as we sow'd,
"Through ev'ry Shrine should be bestow'd.
"And in one Beauty we would take
"Enough a thousand Saints to make.
"And (for I dare not quench the Fire
"That me does for your good inspire)
"'Twere Sacriledge a Mant t'admit
"To holy things, for Heaven fit.
"I see the Angels in a Crown
"On you the Lillies show'ring down:
"And round about you Glory breaks,
"That something more then humane speaks.
"All Beauty, when at such a height,
"Is so already consecrate.
"Fairfax I know; and long ere this
"Have mark'd the Youth, and what he is.
"But can he such a Rival seem
"For whom you Heav'n should disesteem?
"Ah, no! and 'twould more Honour prove
"He your Devoto were, then Love.
Here live beloved, and obey'd:
Each one your Sister, each your Maid.
"And, if our Rule seem strictly pend,
"The Rule it self to you shall bend.
"Our Abbess too, now far in Age,
"Doth your succession near presage.
"How soft the yoke on us would lye,
"Might such fair Hands as yours it tye!
"Your voice, the sweetest of the Quire,
"Shall draw Heav'n nearer, raise us higher.
"And your Example, if our Head,
"Will soon us to perfection lead.
"Those Virtues to us all so dear,
"Will straight grow Sanctity when here:
"And that, once sprung, increase so fast
"Till Miracles it work at last.
"Nor is our Order yet so nice,
"Delight to banish as a Vice.
"Here Pleasure Piety doth meet;
"One perfecting the other Sweet.
"So through the mortal fruit we boyl
"The Sugars uncorrupting Oyl:
"And that which perisht while we pull,
"Is thus preserved clear and full.
"For such indeed are all our Arts;
"Still handling Natures finest Parts.
"Flow'rs dress the Altars; for the Clothes,
"The Sea-born Amber we compose;
"Balms for the griv'd we draw; and pasts
"We mold, as Baits for curious tasts.
"What need is here of Man? unless
"These as sweet Sins we should confess.
"Each Night among us to your side
"Appoint a fresh and Virgin Bride;
"Whom if Our Lord at midnight find,
"Yet Neither should be left behind.
"Where you may lye as chast in Bed,
"As Pearls together billeted.
"All Night embracing Arm in Arm,
"Like Chrystal pure with Cotton warm.
"But what is this to all the store
"Of Joys you see, and may make more!
"Try but a while, if you be wise:
"The Tryal neither Costs, nor Tyes.
Now Fairfax seek her promis'd faith:
Religion that dispensed hath;
Which She hence forward does begin;
The Nuns smooth Tongue has suckt her in.
Oft, though he knew it was in vain,
Yet would he valiantly complain.
"Is this that Sanctity so great,
"An Art by which you finly'r cheat
"Hypocrite Witches, hence Avant,
"Who though in prison yet inchant!
"Death only can such Theeves make fast,
"As rob though in the Dungeon cast.
"Were there but, when this House was made,
"One Stone that a just Hand had laid,
"It must have fall'n upon her Head
"Who first Thee from thy Faith misled.
"And yet, how well soever ment,
"With them 'twould soon grow fraudulent
"For like themselves they alter all,
"And vice infects the very Wall.
"But sure those Buildings last not long,
"Founded by Folly, kept by Wrong.
"I know what Fruit their Gardens yield,
"When they it think by Night conceal'd.
"Fly from their Vices. 'Tis thy state,
"Not Thee, that they would consecrate.
"Fly from their Ruine. How I fear
"Though guiltless lest thou perish there.
What should he do? He would respect
Religion, but not Right neglect:
For first Religion taught him Right,
And dazled not but clear'd his sight.
Sometimes resolv'd his Sword he draws,
But reverenceth then the Laws:
"For Justice still that Courage led;
First from a Judge, then Souldier bred.
Small Honour would be in the Storm.
The Court him grants the lawful Form;
Which licens'd either Peace or Force,
To hinder the unjust Divorce.
Yet still the Nuns his Right debar'd,
Standing upon their holy Guard.
Ill-counsell'd Women, do you know
Whom you resist, or what you do?
Is not this he whose Offspring fierce
Shall fight through all the Universe;
And with successive Valour try
France, Poland, either Germany;
Till one, as long since prophecy'd,
His Horse through conquer'd Britain ride?
Yet, against Fate, his Spouse they kept;
And the great Race would intercept.
Some to the Breach against their Foes
Their Wooden Saints in vain oppose
Another bolder stands at push
With their old Holy-Water Brush.
While the disjointed Abbess threads
The gingling Chain-shot of her Beads.
But their lowd'st Cannon were their Lungs;
And sharpest Weapons were their Tongues.
But, waving these aside like Flyes,
Young Fairfax through the Wall does rise.
Then th' unfrequented Vault appear'd,
And superstitions vainly fear'd.
The Relicks False were set to view;
Only the Jewels there were true.
But truly bright and holy Thwaites
That weeping at the Altar waites.
But the glad Youth away her bears,
And to the Nuns bequeaths her Tears:
Who guiltily their Prize bemoan,
Like Gipsies that a Child hath stoln.
Thenceforth (as when th' Inchantment ends
The Castle vanishes or rends)
The wasting Cloister with the rest
Was in one instant dispossest.
At the demolishing, this Seat
To Fairfax fell as by Escheat.
And what both Nuns and Founders will'd
'Tis likely better thus fulfill'd,
For if the Virgin prov'd not theirs,
The Cloyster yet remained hers.
Though many a Nun there made her vow,
'Twas no Religious-House till now.
From that blest Bed the Heroe came,
Whom France and Poland yet does fame:
Who, when retired here to Peace,
His warlike Studies could not cease;
But laid these Gardens out in sport
In the just Figure of a Fort;
And with five Bastions it did fence,
As aiming one for ev'ry Sense.
When in the East the Morning Ray
Hangs out the Colours of the Day,
The Bee through these known Allies hums,
Beating the Dian with its Drumms.
Then Flow'rs their drowsie Eylids raise,
Their Silken Ensigns each displayes,
And dries its Pan yet dank with Dew,
And fills its Flask with Odours new.
These, as their Governour goes by,
In fragrant Vollyes they let fly;
And to salute their Governess
Again as great a charge they press:
None for the Virgin Nymph; for She
Seems with the Flow'rs a Flow'r to be.
And think so still! though not compare
With Breath so sweet, or Cheek so faire.
Well shot ye Fireman! Oh how sweet,
And round your equal Fires do meet;
Whose shrill report no Ear can tell,
But Ecchoes to the Eye and smell.
See how the Flow'rs, as at Parade,
Under their Colours stand displaid:
Each Regiment in order grows,
That of the Tulip Pinke and Rose.
But when the vigilant Patroul
Of Stars walks round about the Pole,
Their Leaves, that to the stalks are curl'd,
Seem to their Staves the Ensigns furl'd.
Then in some Flow'rs beloved Hut
Each Bee as Sentinel is shut;
And sleeps so too: but, if once stir'd,
She runs you through, or askes The Word.
Oh Thou, that dear and happy Isle
The Garden of the World ere while,
Thou Paradise of four Seas,
Which Heaven planted us to please,
But, to exclude the World, did guard
With watry if not flaming Sword;
What luckless Apple did we tast,
To make us Mortal, and The Wast.
Unhappy! shall we never more
That sweet Milltia restore,
When Gardens only had their Towrs,
And all the Garrisons were Flow'rs,
When Roses only Arms might bear,
And Men did rosie Garlands wear?
Tulips, in several Colours barr'd,
Were then the Switzers of our Guard.
The Gardiner had the Souldiers place,
And his more gentle Forts did trace.
The Nursery of all things green
Was then the only Magazeen.
The Winter Quarters were the Stoves,
Where he the tender Plants removes.
But War all this doth overgrow:
We Ord'nance Plant and Powder sow.
And yet their walks one on the Sod
Who, had it pleased him and God,
Might once have made our Gardens spring
Fresh as his own and flourishing.
But he preferr'd to the Cinque Ports
These five imaginary Forts:
And, in those half-dry Trenches, spann'd
Pow'r which the Ocean might command.
For he did, with his utmost Skill,
Ambition weed, but Conscience till.
Conscience, that Heaven-nursed Plant,
Which most our Earthly Gardens want.
A prickling leaf it bears, and such
As that which shrinks at ev'ry touch;
But Flow'rs eternal, and divine,
That in the Crowns of Saints do shine.
The sight does from these Bastions ply,
Th' invisible Artilery;
And at proud Cawood Castle seems
To point the Battery of its Beams.
As if it quarrell'd in the Seat
Th' Ambition of its Prelate great.
But ore the Meads below it plays,
Or innocently seems to gaze.
And now to the Abbyss I pass
Of that unfathomable Grass,
Where Men like Grashoppers appear,
But Grashoppers are Gyants there:
They, in there squeking Laugh, contemn
Us as we walk more low then them:
And, from the Precipices tall
Of the green spir's, to us do call.
To see Men through this Meadow Dive,
We wonder how they rise alive.
As, under Water, none does know
Whether he fall through it or go.
But, as the Marriners that sound,
And show upon their Lead the Ground,
They bring up Flow'rs so to be seen,
And prove they've at the Bottom been.
No Scene that turns with Engines strange
Does oftner then these Meadows change,
For when the Sun the Grass hath vext,
The tawny Mowers enter next;
Who seem like Israaliies to be,
Walking on foot through a green Sea.
To them the Grassy Deeps divide,
And crowd a Lane to either Side.
With whistling Sithe, and Elbow strong,
These Massacre the Grass along:
While one, unknowing, carves the Rail,
Whose yet unfeather'd Quils her fail.
The Edge all bloody from its Breast
He draws, and does his stroke detest;
Fearing the Flesh untimely mow'd
To him a Fate as black forebode.
But bloody Thestylis, that waites
To bring the mowing Camp their Cates,
Greedy as Kites has trust it up,
And forthwith means on it to sup:
When on another quick She lights,
And cryes, he call'd us Israelites;
But now, to make his saying true,
Rails rain for Quails, for Manna Dew.
Unhappy Birds! what does it boot
To build below the Grasses Root;
When Lowness is unsafe as Hight,
And Chance o'retakes what scapeth spight?
And now your Orphan Parents Call
Sounds your untimely Funeral.
Death-Trumpets creak in such a Note,
And 'tis the Sourdine in their Throat.
Or sooner hatch or higher build:
The Mower now commands the Field;
In whose new Traverse seemeth wrought
A Camp of Battail newly fought:
Where, as the Meads with Hay, the Plain
Lyes quilted ore with Bodies slain:
The Women that with forks it filing,
Do represent the Pillaging.
And now the careless Victors play,
Dancing the Triumphs of the Hay;
Where every Mowers wholesome Heat
Smells like an Alexanders Sweat.
Their Females fragrant as the Mead
Which they in Fairy Circles tread:
When at their Dances End they kiss,
Their new-made Hay not sweeter is.
When after this 'tis pil'd in Cocks,
Like a calm Sea it shews the Rocks:
We wondring in the River near
How Boats among them safely steer.
Or, like the Desert Memphis Sand,
Short Pyramids of Hay do stand.
And such the Roman Camps do rise
In Hills for Soldiers Obsequies.
This Scene again withdrawing brings
A new and empty Face of things;
A levell'd space, as smooth and plain,
As Clothes for Lilly strecht to stain.
The World when first created sure
Was such a Table rase and pure.
Or rather such is the Toril
Ere the Bulls enter at Madril.
For to this naked equal Flat,
Which Levellers take Pattern at,
The Villagers in common chase
Their Cattle, which it closer rase;
And what below the Sith increast
Is pincht yet nearer by the Breast.
Such, in the painted World, appear'd
Davenant with th'Universal Heard.
They seem within the polisht Grass
A landskip drawen in Looking-Glass.
And shrunk in the huge Pasture show
As spots, so shap'd, on Faces do.
Such Fleas, ere they approach the Eye,
In Multiplyiug Glasses lye.
They feed so wide, so slowly move,
As Constellatious do above.
Then, to conclude these pleasant Acts,
Denton sets ope its Cataracts;
And makes the Meadow truly be
(What it but seem'd before) a Sea.
For, jealous of its Lords long stay,
It try's t'invite him thus away.
The River in it self is drown'd,
And Isl's th' astonish Cattle round.
Let others tell the Paradox,
How Eels now bellow in the Ox;
How Horses at their Tails do kick,
Turn'd as they hang to Leeches quick;
How Boats can over Bridges sail;
And Fishes do the Stables scale.
How Salmons trespassing are found;
And Pikes are taken in the Pound.
But I, retiring from the Flood,
Take Sanctuary in the Wood;
And, while it lasts, my self imbark
In this yet green, yet growing Ark;
Where the first Carpenter might best
Fit Timber for his Keel have Prest.
And where all Creatures might have shares,
Although in Armies, not in Paires.
The double Wood of ancient Stocks
Link'd in so thick, an Union locks,
It like two Pedigrees appears,
On one hand Fairfax, th' other Veres:
Of whom though many fell in War,
Yet more to Heaven shooting are:
And, as they Natures Cradle deckt,
Will in green Age her Hearse expect.
When first the Eye this Forrest sees
It seems indeed as Wood not Trees:
As if their Neighbourhood so old
To one great Trunk them all did mold.
There the huge Bulk takes place, as ment
To thrust up a Fifth Element;
And stretches still so closely wedg'd
As if the Night within were hedg'd.
Dark all without it knits; within
It opens passable and thin;
And in as loose an order grows,
As the Corinthean Porticoes.
The Arching Boughs unite between
The Columnes of the Temple green;
And underneath the winged Quires
Echo about their tuned Fires.
The Nightingale does here make choice
To sing the Tryals of her Voice.
Low Shrubs she sits in, and adorns
With Musick high the squatted Thorns.
But highest Oakes stoop down to hear,
And listning Elders prick the Ear.
The Thorn, lest it should hurt her, draws
Within the Skin its shrunken claws.
But I have for my Musick found
A Sadder, yet more pleasing Sound:
The Stock-doves whose fair necks are grac'd
With Nuptial Rings their Ensigns chast;
Yet always, for some Cause unknown,
Sad pair unto the Elms they moan.
O why should such a Couple mourn,
That in so equal Flames do burn!
Then as I carless on the Bed
Of gelid Straw-berryes do tread,
And through the Hazles thick espy
The hatching Thrastles shining Eye,
The Heron from the Ashes top,
The eldest of its young lets drop,
As if it Stork-like did pretend
That Tribute to its Lord to send.
But most the Hewel's wonders are,
Who here has the Holt-felsters care.
He walks still upright from the Root,
Meas'ring the Timber with his Foot;
And all the way, to keep it clean,
Doth from the Bark the Wood-moths glean.
He, with his Beak, examines well
Which fit to stand and which to fell.
The good he numbers up, and hacks;
As if he mark'd them with the Ax.
But where he, tinkling with his Beak,
Does find the hollow Oak to speak,
That for his building he designs,
And through the tainted Side he mines.
Who could have thought the tallest Oak
Should fall by such a feeble Strok'!
Nor would it, had the Tree not fed
A Traitor-worm, within it bred.
(As first our Flesh corrupt within
Tempts impotent and bashful Sin.
And yet that Worm triumphs not long,
But serves to feed the Hewels young.
While the Oake seems to fall content,
Viewing the Treason's Punishment.
Thus I, easie Philosopher,
Among the Birds and Trees confer:
And little now to make me, wants
Or of the Fowles, or of the Plants.
Give me but Wings as they, and I
Streight floting on the Air shall fly:
Or turn me but, and you shall see
I was but an inverted Tree.
Already I begin to call
In their most-learned Original:
And where I Language want,my Signs
The Bird upon the Bough divines;
And more attentive there doth sit
Then if She were with Lime-twigs knit.
No Leaf does tremble in the Wind
Which I returning cannot find.
Out of these scatter'd Sibyls Leaves
Strange Prophecies my Phancy weaves:
And in one History consumes,
Like Mexique Paintings, all the Plumes.
What Rome, Greece, Palestine, ere said
I in this light Mosaick read.
Thrice happy he who, not mistook,
Hath read in Natures mystick Book.
And see how Chance's better Wit
Could with a Mask my studies hit!
The Oak-Leaves me embroyder all,
Between which Caterpillars crawl:
And Ivy, with familiar trails,
Me licks, and clasps, and curles, and hales.
Under this antick Cope I move
Like some great Prelate of the Grove,
Then, languishing with ease, I toss
On Pallets swoln of Velvet Moss;
While the Wind, cooling through the Boughs,
Flatters with Air my panting Brows.
Thanks for my Rest ye Mossy Banks,
And unto you cool Zephyr's Thanks,
Who, as my Hair, my Thoughts too shed,
And winnow from the Chaff my Head.
How safe, methinks, and strong, behind
These Trees have I incamp'd my Mind;
Where Beauty, aiming at the Heart,
Bends in some Tree its useless Dart;
And where the World no certain Shot
Can make, or me it toucheth not.
But I on it securely play,
And gaul its Horsemen all the Day.
Bind me ye Woodbines in your 'twines,
Curle me about ye gadding Vines,
And Oh so close your Circles lace,
That I may never leave this Place:
But, lest your Fetters prove too weak,
Ere I your Silken Bondage break,
Do you, O Brambles, chain me too,
And courteous Briars nail me though.
Here in the Morning tye my Chain,
Where the two Woods have made a Lane;
While, like a Guard on either side,
The Trees before their Lord divide;
This, like a long and equal Thread,
Betwixt two Labyrinths does lead.
But, where the Floods did lately drown,
There at the Ev'ning stake me down.
For now the Waves are fal'n and dry'd,
And now the Meadows fresher dy'd;
Whose Grass, with moister colour dasht,
Seems as green Silks but newly washt.
No Serpent new nor Crocodile
Remains behind our little Nile;
Unless it self you will mistake,
Among these Meads the only Snake.
See in what wanton harmless folds
It ev'ry where the Meadow holds;
And its yet muddy back doth lick,
Till as a Chrystal Mirrour slick;
Where all things gaze themselves, and doubt
If they be in it or without.
And for his shade which therein shines,
Narcissus like, the Sun too pines.
Oh what a Pleasure 'tis to hedge
My Temples here with heavy sedge;
Abandoning my lazy Side,
Stretcht as a Bank unto the Tide;
Or to suspend my sliding Foot
On the Osiers undermined Root,
And in its Branches tough to hang,
While at my Lines the Fishes twang!
But now away my Hooks, my Quills,
And Angles, idle Utensils.
The Young Maria walks to night:
Hide trifling Youth thy Pleasures slight.
'Twere shame that such judicious Eyes
Should with such Toyes a Man surprize;
She that already is the Law
Of all her Sex, her Ages Aw.
See how loose Nature, in respect
To her, it self doth recollect;
And every thing so whisht and fine,
Starts forth with to its Bonne Mine.
The Sun himself, of Her aware,
Seems to descend with greater Care,
And lest She see him go to Bed,
In blushing Clouds conceales his Head.
So when the Shadows laid asleep
From underneath these Banks do creep,
And on the River as it flows
With Eben Shuts begin to close;
The modest Halcyon comes in sight,
Flying betwixt the Day and Night;
And such an horror calm and dumb,
Admiring Nature does benum.
The viscous Air, wheres'ere She fly,
Follows and sucks her Azure dy;
The gellying Stream compacts below,
If it might fix her shadow so;
The Stupid Fishes hang, as plain
As Flies in Chrystal overt'ane,
And Men the silent Scene assist,
Charm'd with the saphir-winged Mist.
Maria such, and so doth hush
The World, and through the Ev'ning rush.
No new-born Comet such a Train
Draws through the Skie, nor Star new-slain.
For streight those giddy Rockets fail,
Which from the putrid Earth exhale,
But by her Flames, in Heaven try'd,
Nature is wholly Vitrifi'd.
'Tis She that to these Gardens gave
That wondrous Beauty which they have;
She streightness on the Woods bestows;
To Her the Meadow sweetness owes;
Nothing could make the River be
So Chrystal-pure but only She;
She yet more Pure, Sweet, Streight, and Fair,
Then Gardens, Woods, Meads, Rivers are.
Therefore what first She on them spent,
They gratefully again present.
The Meadow Carpets where to tread;
The Garden Flow'rs to Crown Her Head;
And for a Glass the limpid Brook,
Where She may all her Beautyes look;
But, since She would not have them seen,
The Wood about her draws a Skreen.
For She, to higher Beauties rais'd,
Disdains to be for lesser prais'd.
She counts her Beauty to converse
In all the Languages as hers;
Not yet in those her self imployes
But for the Wisdome, not the Noyse;
Nor yet that Wisdome would affect,
But as 'tis Heavens Dialect.
Blest Nymph! that couldst so soon prevent
Those Trains by Youth against thee meant;
Tears (watry Shot that pierce the Mind;)
And Sighs (Loves Cannon charg'd with Wind;)
True Praise (That breaks through all defence;)
And feign'd complying Innocence;
But knowing where this Ambush lay,
She scap'd the safe, but roughest Way.
This 'tis to have been from the first
In a Domestick Heaven nurst,
Under the Discipline severe
Of Fairfax, and the starry Vere;
Where not one object can come nigh
But pure, and spotless as the Eye;
And Goodness doth it self intail
On Females, if there want a Male.
Go now fond Sex that on your Face
Do all your useless Study place,
Nor once at Vice your Brows dare knit
Lest the smooth Forehead wrinkled sit
Yet your own Face shall at you grin,
Thorough the Black-bag of your Skin;
When knowledge only could have fill'd
And Virtue all those Furows till'd.
Hence She with Graces more divine
Supplies beyond her Sex the Line;
And, like a sprig of Misleto,
On the Fairfacian Oak does grow;
Whence, for some universal good,
The Priest shall cut the sacred Bud;
While her glad Parents most rejoice,
And make their Destiny their Choice.
Mean time ye Fields, Springs, Bushes, Flow'rs,
Where yet She leads her studious Hours,
(Till Fate her worthily translates,
And find a Fairfax for our Thwaites)
Employ the means you have by Her,
And in your kind your selves preferr;
That, as all Virgins She preceds,
So you all Woods, Streams, Gardens, Meads.
For you Thessalian Tempe's Seat
Shall now be scorn'd as obsolete;
Aranjeuz, as less, disdain'd;
The Bel-Retiro as constrain'd;
But name not the Idalian Grove,
For 'twas the Seat of wanton Love;
Much less the Dead's Elysian Fields,
Yet nor to them your Beauty yields.
'Tis not, what once it was, the World;
But a rude heap together hurl'd;
All negligently overthrown,
Gulfes, Deserts, Precipices, Stone.
Your lesser World contains the same.
But in more decent Order tame;
You Heaven's Center, Nature's Lap.
And Paradice's only Map.
But now the Salmon-Fishers moist
Their Leathern Boats begin to hoist;
And, like Antipodes in Shoes,
Have shod their Heads in their Canoos.
How Tortoise like, but not so slow,
These rational Amphibii go?
Let's in: for the dark Hemisphere
Does now like one of them appear.

My husband Vinny Christensen
He's now thirty seven, but he looks younger
He has beautiful eyes with his sweet smile
Making my heart beats a little faster.
He works as technical consultant at Telenor
Never felt bored solving problems for his customers
He has a lot of wonderful colleagues
Ronny, Daniel are so sweet, they are his best partners.
Vinny loves so much his music
He's fantastic, all the lyrics he wrote
He makes wonderful words rhymes
Melody's brighten like blue skies, made me cry some time I suppose.
He has the rhythms in his heart
Writing a song so fast, he is a talented
Playing all the music instruments he can
Piano, Guitar, Ukelele, etc. I don't understand..Why he's so fascinated!
He's now writing me a beautiful song
He said not so long he will totally complete it
RAE is the name he named his latest song
It will be the greatest as it belongs, he makes me really appreciated!
I love my husband so much
My face is all blushed like a light pink rose
He is a perfect wonderful and gently man
Like white sparkling sand, he's the man I chose!

Like some raw sophister that mounts the pulpit,
So trembles a young poet at a full pit.
Unused to crowds, the parson quakes for fear,
And wonders how the devil he durst come there;
Wanting three talents needful for the place,
Some beard, some learning, and some little grace.
Nor is the puny poet void of care;
For authors, such as our new authors are,
Have not much learning, nor much wit to spare;
And as for grace, to tell the truth, there's scarce one,
But has as little as the very parson:
Both say, they preach and write for your instruction;
But 'tis for a third day, and for induction.
The difference is, that though you like the play,
The poet's gain is ne'er beyond his day;
But with the parson 'tis another case,
He, without holiness, may rise to grace;
The poet has one disadvantage more,
That if his play be dull, he's damned all o'er,
Not only a damn'd blockhead, but damn'd poor.
But dulness well becomes the sable garment;
I warrant that ne'er spoiled a priest's preferment;
Wit's not his business, and as wit now goes,
Sirs, 'tis not so much yours as you suppose,
For you like nothing now but nauseous beaux.
You laugh not, gallants, as by proof appears,
At what his beauship says, but what he wears;
So 'tis your eyes are tickled, not your ears.
The tailor and the furrier find the stuff,
The wit lies in the dress, and monstrous muff.
The truth on 't is, the payment of the pit
Is like for like, clipt money for clipt wit.
You cannot from our absent author hope,
He should equip the stage with such a fop.
Fools change in England, and new fools arise;
For, though the immortal species never dies,
Yet every year new maggots make new flies.
But where he lives abroad, he scarce can find
One fool, for million that he left behind.

The world had chafed his spirit proud
By its wearing, crushing strife,
The censure of the thoughtless crowd
Had touched a blameless life;
Like the dove of old, from the water’s foam,
He wearily turned to the ark of home.
Hopes he had cherished with joyous heart,
Had toiled for many a day,
With body and spirit, and patient art,
Like mists had melted away;
And o’er day-dreams vanished, o’er fond hopes flown,
He sat him down to mourn alone.
No, not alone, for soft fingers rest
On his hot and aching brow,
Back the damp hair is tenderly pressed
While a sweet voice whispers low:
“Thy joys have I shared, O my husband true,
And shall I not share thy sorrows too?”
Vain task to resist the loving gaze
That so fondly meets his own,
Revealing a heart that cares for praise
From him and him alone;
And though censure and grief upon him pall,
Unto to her, at least, he is all in all.
What though false friends should turn aside,
Or chill with icy look;
What though he meet the pitying pride,
The proud heart ill can brook;
There are depths of love in one gentle heart,
Whose faith with death alone will part.
Aye! well may thy brow relax its gloom,
For a talisman hast thou
’Gainst hopes that are blighted in their bloom,
’Gainst scornful look or brow—
Her heart is a high and a holy throne
Where monarch supreme thou reignest alone.
Kindly return her tender gaze,
Press closely that little hand,
Whisper fond words and soothing praise—
They are ever at thy command;
It is all the harvest she asks to reap
In return for love as the ocean deep.

O Lord, Thou hear'st my daily moan
And see'st my dropping tears.
My troubles all are Thee before,
My longings and my fears.
Thou hitherto hast been my God;
Thy help my soul hath found.
Though loss and sickness me assailed,
Through Thee I've kept my ground.
And Thy abode Thou'st made with me;
With Thee my soul can talk;
In secret places Thee I find
Where I do kneel or walk.
Though husband dear be from me gone,
Whom I do love so well,
I have a more beloved one
Whose comforts far excel.
O stay my heart on Thee. my God,
Uphold my fainting soul.
And when I know not what to do,
I'll on Thy mercies roll.
My weakness. Thou dost know full well
Of body and of mind;
I in this world no comfort have,
But what from Thee I find.
Though children Thou has given me,
And friends I have also,
Yet if I see Thee not through them
They are no joy, but woe.
O shine upon me, blessed Lord,
Ev'n for my Saviour's sake;
In Thee alone is more than all,
And there content I'll take.
O hear me, Lord, in this request
As Thou before hast done,
Bring back my husband, I beseech,
As Thou didst once my son.
So shall I celebrate Thy praise
Ev'n while my days shall last
And talk to my beloved one
Of all Thy goodness past.
So both of us Thy kindness, Lord,
With praises shall recount
And serve Thee better than before
Whose blessings thus surmount.
But give me, Lord, a better heart,
Then better shall I be,
To pay the vows which I do owe
Forever unto Thee.
Unless Thou help, what can I do
But still my frailty show?
If Thou assist me, Lord,
I shall Return Thee what I owe.

It is true:
My husband
has never
taken out
the garbage
from our little house
in the suburbs.
My husband
has never
taken our children
out for the night
to trick-or-treating
as I sit
on the porch in a witch hat.
My husband
has never
come home from
a long day
to a special meal
I have prepared
just for him.
My husband
has never
told me he loves me
beside a warm fire
on our honeymoon.
But he will.

What ever happened to the husband and wife
What ever happened to love
What ever happened to the dreams they thought right
That they both thought so much of
What ever happened to the holding of hands
Or the whispers of secrets to keep
Did it somehow slip away with the time
Is it somewhere still hidden beneath
What ever happened to the words I do
Replaced now with words of cruel
Does somehow it still linger on
Is love only lost and confused
What ever happened to the romance
And the love that was in each breath we took
Must somehow be forgotten now
Was this in the chances we took
What ever happened to the husband and wife
What ever happened to love
What will now happen to the rest of our lives
For love, was it overlooked
What will now happen to the dreams we once had
When the world was right at our feet
Is love somehow still hidden somewhere
Or is this the way it must be
There once was a time when it meant so much more
When love walked with us in life
What ever happened to the love in our hearts
What happened to the husband and wife.

The ardent fan ready before wedlock
To drop priorities for this loving dame
Dawn’s beverage with mesmerizing shock
Of even the newspaper now stuck to blame!

I leave for thee, beloved one,
The home and friends of youth,
Trusting my hopes, my happiness,
Unto thy love and truth;
I leave for thee my girlhood's joys,
Its sunny, careless mirth,
To bear henceforth my share amid
The many cares of earth.
And yet, no wild regret I give
To all that now I leave,
The golden dreams, the flow'ry wreaths
That I no more may weave;
The future that before me lies
A dark and unknown sea --
Whate'er may be its storms or shoals,
I brave them all with thee!
I will not tell thee now of love
Whose life, ere this, thou'st guessed,
And which, like sacred secret, long
Was treasured in my breast;
Enough that if thy lot be calm,
Or storms should o'er it sweep,
Thou'lt learn that it is woman's love,
Unchanging, pure and deep.
If this life's sunshine gild thy lot,
Bestowing wealth and pride,
Its light enjoying, I shall stand,
Rejoicing, at thy side;
But, oh! if thou should'st prove the griefs
That blight thy fellow-men,
'Twill be my highest, dearest right,
To be, love, with thee then.
And thou, wilt thou not promise me
Thy heart will never change,
That tones and looks, so loving now,
Will ne'er grow stern and strange?
That thou'lt be kind, whatever faults
Or failings may be mine,
And bear with them in patient love,
As I will bear with thine?

Pardon the faults in me,
For the love of years ago:
Good-bye.
I must drift across the sea,
I must sink into the snow,
I must die.
You can bask in this sun,
You can drink wine, and eat:
Good-bye.
I must gird myself and run,
Though with unready feet:
I must die.
Blank sea to sail upon,
Cold bed to sleep in:
Good-bye.
While you clasp, I must be gone
For all your weeping:
I must die.
A kiss for one friend,
And a word for two,—
Good-bye:—
A lock that you must send,
A kindness you must do:
I must die.
Not a word for you,
Not a lock or kiss,
Good-bye.
We, one, must part in two;
Verily death is this:
I must die.

See the cotton flower
It is most valuable,
Like the cotton flower
The true poet sacrifice
Himself for the welfare
Of others and forget
His own identity.
Thanks Tulsiji, you proved it.

To the P.H management....
I've been suffering
A loss of identity lately
I'm sure that you can see
That the person I once was
Is not currently who I be...
I've been feeling slightly odd lately
And I wish that I could say
That I'll be over it quite quickly
But I think I've lost my way...
My bearings are all boggled
And I've gotten all mixed up
Am I really upside down...
Or is it actually downside up? ?
I have no wish to offend thee
But surely you can see
If you give me back my maple leaf
I'll be as happy as can be! !
Dee Daffodil (HW)  11 Sep,2007

I suffer from the worldliness
I suffer in silence
A loss of identity
Adience
I think
You give me
A sense of identity
Love
(2009/11/9)

Dig deep
Who are you
What do you want
How do you want be seen and remembered
Dig deep
What makes you happy, frustrated, angry, peaceful, free
Yeah the world tells you who to be
Blurs your vision
Smears away your identity
So take hold
Embrace this moment for yourself
Define your own identity
Reflect on how to achieve what makes you happy
Done scrambling around
Trying to please all others' wants
Put your wisdom first and the rest is sure to come

Identity
Where is my identity
That I can show you
I am that, I am this,
And how can I show you
That I am Yours.
I am covered with falsehood
I am Truth and Truth has
No identity as You know,
No identity, no affinity,
And here I am in distress,
And here I am in dark .
O my dear, enlightened me
With knowledge that I am Yours.

Mama Africa's identity,
And of the Fulanis and the Fulbes;
But the Savannah and the Sahara are here to stay in Africa.
Mama Africa's identity,
And of the Dogons and the Shilluks;
And of the cowries usedas money in those days,
But the identities of the African are in many faces.
It is like a durbar in Africa and,
At the market plac to meet others;
But a visit to the tomatoes market in Ghana will tell you much.
Mama African's identity,
And like 'the Golden Stool' of the Ashanti Kingsdom!
But wait for the dried-fish on the coasts of Africa.
Visit St. Louis in the delta of Senegal and learn about the ways of the African,
For my home i in El Molo;
And like Mama Africa's identity praising my muse.
Mama African's identity,
And of the pygmies in Central Africa!
But i have my mind on the Rift Valley,
And like the mirror of the rivers, lakes and the seas of Africa! !
The Massai and the Dinka do play their roles,
And like the Nubaians in South Sudan;
But with the temperature above 40 degrees in most parts of Africa.
Mama Africa's identity,
And like a message to my lover in Lalibala;
For early in the morning came the leopards to drink some water,
But a visit to Mount Meru will entice you.
Mama Africa's identity,
And of the Zulus and the Rendilles;
But the Afars are here to blend with the dry land.
Mama Africa's identity,
With the rhythms and rituals of the Africans!
And like the tribes of Ovambo, Herero, Xhosa, Shona and Matabele.
And like the Bemba, the Tonga and the Ovaimbundu!
But the red land of Africa care for you all.
Mama Africa's identity,
And of River Limpopo in the mist of love;
But try to visit the Victoria Falls to satisfy your curiosity.
Mama Africa's identity,
And of the Himbas with their traditional dance;
But the Kikuyu, the Hutu, the Tutsi and the Hambukushu are also there,
For Africa is a very big continent for all of us.

After years of aimless wanderings
Leaving behind the cities of midnight revels
And the fevered journey in metro rails,
I am back at the land of my people.
My land, I had carried
Wherever I went,
Under which ever roof I slept
As a jewel in a casket
And ensured it rested safe
Ever under my pillow
Moving with aliens
Unable to merge with their cultural mores
I saw my land glimmer in darkness
Like dew drop on a moon blanched leaf
When I sweated in the blistering sands
That patch of green landscape, like an oasis
Wafted me in a cool embrace
Then dreams poured in like star light
And I wandered in the meadows of my youthful love
My heart struggling to forget old longings
And memories lashing upon me like tidal waves
Pursued by an inalienable shadow
Suddenly being born in flesh and blood
I hastened to the streets of my youth
With hopes galore and plans vivid
But alas! There is none to recognize me
Oh! I am a stranger here
An unwelcome stranger among total strangers
Now I wonder which really is my land
The one left behind or the one just landed in
Oscillating between these two worlds
My fractured identity looms large
With worms of memories wriggling in my flesh
And a myth dying in my brain

I am known to some
Who do not know me
Some claim to know me
Yet do not know me.
Mysterious is the connection
Yours and mine
Like roots of trees intertwined
beneath the ground
Claimed by each tree above
As its own.
Roots understand it all!
Whatever I call mine
Isn't really mine
What I do not think as mine
Embraces me with such love.
Who thou are that walk by me?

If ever I dreamed of my dead name
High in the heart of London, unsurpassed
By Time for ever, and the Fugitive, Fame,
There seeking a long sanctuary at last,
I better that; and recollect with shame
How once I longed to hide it from life's heats
Under those holy cypresses, the same
That shade always the quiet place of Keats,
Now rather thank I God there is no risk
Of gravers scoring it with florid screed,
But let my death be memoried on this disc.
Wear it, sweet friend. Inscribe no date nor deed.
But may thy heart-beat kiss it night and day,
Until the name grow vague and wear away.

Truth, The Real God
Not that we have made
Does not want a facade
Of the limited and narrow world that we parade
It asks for a mind rich in Innocence
That doesnt have a scratch of experience
A mind free from time
A mind free from grime
It wants a Being whose heart is Full
Rich, clear which does not get pulled
By jaded and petty eyesight
Just capable of intense feeling in all its might
Be sensitive with your nerves
Your eyes, your body, your voice, your ears
See the beauty of the tree, the smile of the child
The agony of the woman without a meal, the animals in wild
Unless you do, there is no intelligence
It doesnt come with knowledge or experience
Comes with sensitivity and observation
A mind rich in Innocence....

Quiet.
Soft.
Full of peace.
No vandalism.
No wrong.
No sorrow.
No pain.
It's my field of innocence.
It's my life.
The place I dream about.
I know I am very young,
To early for me,
But when I pass.
I will go to this world.
Heaven,
Though, I like to call it field of innocence.
I don't know why.
Seemed fitting.
The innocent are there,
Resting in the quiet peace,
With our Lord Jesus.
I know someday I'll go,
And when I do,
I want to go to Heaven.
My Field Of Innocence.

as innocence is bath drowned
in aircraft carriers of steam blood
pornography elite power rapes

You always looked straight past me
why couldn't you see the truth
he's been doing this to me for years on end
taking away my youth.
Now my innocence is gone forever
and he's the one to blame
the only way I see I can get it back
is to get a rope and hang.
He's hurt me so badly
so many times, in so many ways
and even though it's in the past now
it's still hurting me these days
i'm proud to say i've survived this long
but it all must come to and end
my heart is just too broken to go on
and doing this will help it mend
i love the ones who loved me back
and this is all that's left to say,
i hope to see you all again
in the afterlife someday
Sabrina Perry

When I bypass you passes a chill
Through out my body, o lassi little
What of your possessions that lure me
For you in longing I begin to swim.
You are not a beauty celestial I know
Till my honor for you I can throw
Just to have a glance at you oh virgin
What for it happens I can not imaginbe.
Perhaps I have found in you a dream
With you I see innocence in my dreams
To be associated with my future consort,
Who must too possess an innocent heart.
Dare I can not to speak with you
Fearing it may give me a clue
Or it may throw me in sea of pain
Unveiling before me your non innocence.

You stolen my innocence
As a young child
The painful memories
Filled my childhood with
Tears, hurt, and pain
The unbearable pain
The hurt
You put me though
You lost nothing
You gain power
I lose my innocence
Lost my life
Lost my happiness
Gain nothing but pain
My childhood forgotten
My childhood lost
My childhood stolen by a man
that was my moms friend
You voilatd me
You molesed me
More then I can count on my hands and feet
You took the innocents out of the child
And left pain

Oft have I read that Innocence retreats
Where cooling streams salute ye summer Seats
Singing at ease she roves ye field of flowrs
Or safe with shepheards lys among the bowrs
But late alas I crossd a country fare
And found No Strephon nor Dorinda there
There Hodge & William Joynd to cully ned
While Ned was drinking Hodge & William dead
There Cicely Jeard by day the slips of Nell
& ere ye night was ended Cicely fell
Are these the Virtues which adorn the plain
Ye bards forsake your old Arcadian Vein
To sheep those tender Innocents resign
The place where swains & nymphs are said to shine
Swains twice as Wicked Nymphs but half as sage
Tis sheep alone retrieve ye golden age.

Sentenced to death for a crime I did not commit,
Execution at dawn... such a cliché,
All of my last request's denied,
Morning arrives on the final day of my existance,
Paraded through the streets like some kind of prize,
The aroma of life so evident in my final hours,
Dragged up onto this hellish platform, dignity stripped,
These man made gallows offer such a view 0f life,
How ironic that life is  my final view when death comes to call,
Blindfold refused, rope placed around my neck,
Trembling uncontrolably... Goodbye cruel world,
Trap door opens and I fall, neck snapped like a twig,
Spiraling deeper and deeper into the darkness of the abyss,
May the maker have mercy upon my soul...
Spread the love... The peace will follow...

The eye of the sunflower
Stares into the clear skies;
Acres of bright, yellow effluence
Mimic
The voice of innocence.
Red earth
Weaves a dissolving silence
Into the wilderness of the valley.
The phantoms are exiled to meditation
By the voice of innocence.
In the chosen web,
Stirs a fly, vanquished to submission.
The pastures of winged worlds are closed
And the prey trembles
With the voice of innocence.

Last year my mother died.
I was not there; she died alone.
It was mid-winter when
we buried her. The roads were treacherous
that day, the coldest of the year.
Few people made it to the funeral,
the church was nearly empty.
My son and daughter each
read out a poem
she had written in her younger days.
The priest, who had not known her,
said the prayers. From there we went
by car, the tyres crunching on the ice,
to where the grave had been prepared
in the cemetery that waited
on the outskirts of the town.
The ground was frozen hard.
We stood and listened to the prayers
the priest intoned, tall and upright
there above the open grave while
all the time the icy wind blew
flurries of snow over the graves
and by the groves of evergreens,
So cold, so bleak, so utterly unforgettable
the scene, but what was strange:
I did not mind the cold,
that seeped into my heart and bones.
It seemed somehow appropriate.

January
Is
A new month
A new start for me
To learn new things
To learn to let go of my anger
And open up my heart
And to listen to what my heart
Is saying
It is waking up
From a long painful journey
Of last summer
I love you all the time
Sunsets
January
Thanks god you are mild
Because I hate the cold

Only one cell in the frozen hive of night
is lit, or so it seems to us:
this Vietnamese café, with its oily light,
its odors whose colorful shapes are like flowers.
Laughter and talking, the tick of chopsticks.
Beyond the glass, the wintry city
creaks like an ancient wooden bridge.
A great wind rushes under all of us.
The bigger the window, the more it trembles.

💓 💏 💓
We married, on your birthday!
In San Francisco City Hall.
There was no family present,
Just you and I~ that's all!
We were two very young, and
very much in love elopers.
Nothing stood in our way, we
were over-comers, not life-copers.
Who drove from frozen, blizzardly
Chicago to our foggy city by the bay.
We chose to live our lives in our own
unique artistic way.
There was no wedding reception,
no gifts, no band.
Just a couple divinely in love, and
Panagiota so proud to wear that gold
wedding band!
Death took you from this life,
when you were still very young.
But her love for you, remains a song,
that everyday is sung.
And this forever young bride cannot forget
that day.
The sun, the Cable Cars, the glorious fog,
as her tears now fall into San Francisco Bay!
Rest in peace, my love!
Panagiota💐

I don't like January,
It is a cold month
And I enjoy the sun.
In January the sun
Is a pale yellow,
Without an ounce of warmth.
The pale yellow
Of the yolk,
Of a store bought egg.
Is it wrong to prefer
The Orange yolk
Of my own birds
Running strong and free?
And even on warm days
The wind is cold.
In January the wind
Is out of the North.
Not from the southeast
And the Gulf of Mexico.
No, I do not enjoy January.
It is a stark, dreary
Time of year.
Leafless  trees,
And skies the color of denim
Washed a million times over.
There is a knawing
In my gut.
And a sad song in my heart
That longs,
For the rebirth
Of late February.

And the world is passing away
along with its desire, but whoever
does, the God abides forever ****
************ (1 John 2: 17)
So does the human life will pass away eventually
To live for certain years if possible, undeniably
such a desire by anyone and appeal to the Lord
because we have still purpose to be in this world
And the life goes with the time as the world turns
time to time, days, months, years, to that pattern
The year start with the month of January
Month goes by until December annually
But I figure out, January means a lot to me
It is in January that I wish, pray, prompt me
to thank my parent, specially my mother, whom
she let me see the first light from her dark womb
Thank thee to God to the life given until now
and let me see this fantastic world somehow
I wish that I have to live 'til time of senescence
Grant it, so I can still enjoy the universe essence
To be in good health physically and mentally
Continuously be with my friends and family
To let me live every 23rd of January, and thereafter
My desire, and thanks as the world goes to its own venture

Lo! Winter drives his horrors round;
Wide o'er the rugged soil they fly;
In their cold spells each stream is bound,
While at the magic of their eye
Each sign of Spring's gay beauty fades,
And one white wild the aching sight invades.
It is the time for Woe to reign,
And hark! she bids her haggard train,
Pale poverty and want, appear,
Disease, their darling child, draw near,
And, grateful for the favouring hour,
They feel, they seize, they riot, in their power.
But Winter! not to thee alone
Their heart-appalling sway they owe,
For they to war's despotic throne
As tributary subjects bow;
War, who bids trembling Europe gasp,
With wild convulsions in his bloody grasp.
Whence yonder groans? O wretched land!
Poland, from thee, alas! they came,
A despot speaks, and lo! a band,
Blaspheming pure Religion's name,
Bid cold, deliberate murder live,
And death's dread stroke to helpless thousands give.
And see, on Belgia's reeking plain,
Alternate horrors rise and reign!
What mingled sounds affright the ear!
Now, we the song of victory hear,
And now, despair's appalling tone,
And now, of death the deep sepulchral groan.
Freedom! for whose dear sake I'd dare
Each various ill that tortures life,
Though I thy matchless victories share,
While, towering 'midst the bloody strife,
I see thy form sublime, acquire
New power to charm, new beauty to inspire;
I cannot smile; I cannot join
The song of triumph; tho' thy foes,
Celestial power! are also mine;
And tho' I weep for all thy woes,
Yet I thy triumphs too must weep,
And in my tears thy bloody laurels steep.
For who are they that madly bear
Against thy sons the venal spear?
Are they not men?—then say, what power
Can bid my bosom mourn no more;
O where's the fiend-delighting ban
Forbidding MAN to weep for SLAUGHTERED MAN!
E'en Victory, when reflection's voice
Breathes in her ear 'thy brothers die,'
Shall bid her sons no more rejoice,
But change her shouts for pity's sigh:
She will her breast in anguish beat,
And wear the sombrous aspect of defeat.
O Britain! ill-starred land! no more
Must Peace to thee her olive bear,
But on thy once-triumphant shore,
Must we behold the form of fear
Expecting, on the swelling tide,
To see the FOE in proud defiance ride!
Avert the threatening, awful ill;
For fraught with power, and fraught with will
To make thy hardiest veterans die,
A lurking fiend, alas! is nigh,
Who threatens on thy sons to pour
The fatal cloud thou bad'st on GALLIA lower.
Lo! FAMINE spreads her banners wide;[2]
She comes arrayed in horrid state;
But, not to humble Gallia's pride,
And on the rear of victory wait;
She comes the humbled to subdue,
And twine round fading wreaths, death's baleful yew.
She comes to Britain!—at the thought,
Winter! thy scene with horrors fraught,
Fades from my sight—the present ill
Appears to lose its power to kill:
To future scenes pale Fancy flies,
Lifts her dim tearful eyes to heaven, and dies.

At this ancient, battered headland my gaze
Is seaward and merges with the cold blue
Tainted moments of surreal mid winter.
The soft, unbroken vowels of the tide
Are enclosed within the wind's gutturals.
Gulls stutter their syllables of longing.
And I reminisce about time spent here
In wilder days of youth; when summer was
Still green and gold promise and we enjoyed
A certain kind of freedom; that is now
Lost forever deep within the debris
Of these myopic, insubstantial times.
I'll try to recall this freedom clearly,
Before my ageing mind turns foggy grey.

Mission Three: An enemy to erase
Mission Three: An enemy to erase
Early this morning, I awoke from the comforts of my bed.
I immediately gathered the gear I will need for today.
By tomorrow night, another marked enemy will be dead.
At least that is what the words on my covert assignment say.
Slowly across the dense jungle floor, the U. S. Army Ranger silently slide.
I am hunting for the enemy, the marked one, I have been ordered to slay.
In the dense bushes and under the shadows of the trees, I secretly hide.
I am always very careful to cover my tracks along the way.
Quietly moving, I quickly travel unseen across the jungle floor,
I make my way by night; I must be gone by the break of day.
Finally, I am now very close to my enemy’s front door.
Without delay, I am prepared to make this enemy into my prey.
Unseen, I set up my gear in the brush by the unguarded back gate.
I covered myself and concealed my gear under tree limbs and grass.
Carefully, focusing the scope on another enemy I have been ordered to eliminate.
Gently pulling the trigger on the 30-06 sniper rifle, I silently kill his ass.
Now that my assignment has successfully been done,
Quickly, I must make another run for the home base.
The U. S Army Ranger readily waits on the next one.
I wait for the next enemy I am assigned to erase.

Arms around your waist,
And hairflying in the air,
That first joyride on mobike
On Delhi roads sealed our fate.
A lot can happen over coffee,
The best in town you will find,
As we walked hand in hand
Through a plush hotel lobby.
As we sat, you said say yes now,
What, we have just met, I protest.
I know for sure, it’s destined
Please just don’t ask me how.
Love at first sight,
I laughed out loud,
Happens in Mills and Boon,
As we slipped out at night.
I said yes the very next day
Still fills me with disbelief.
Like a hero of romantic movies
You were charming in so many ways.
Now the mobike is gone,
And we travel side by side,
In a luxury air conditioned car.
To  town, to work every morn.
In silence we drive, preoccupied
Hands on lap, hair in place,  I see
A couple on a speeding bike,
And think of that first joyride…

'I have no name;
I am but two days old.'
What shall I call thee?
'I happy am,
Joy is my name.'
Sweet joy befall thee!
Pretty joy!
Sweet joy, but two days old.
Sweet Joy I call thee:
Thou dost smile,
I sing the while;
Sweet joy befall thee!

Then a woman said, "Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow."
And he answered:
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.
Is not the cup that hold your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
Some of you say, "Joy is greater than sorrow," and others say, "Nay, sorrow is the greater."
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.

Joy- joy, enjoy; yeah,
Joy- joy, enjoy
Your prayers,
Your worship, ahoy!
Joy- joy, enjoy; yeah,
Joy- joy, enjoy
There lit, God’s house,
Yonder, a darken hut,
There a feast,
Foods spilled all over,
Yonder, children waiting,
Waiting for dry bread,
Don’t coy—
Joy- joy, enjoy; yeah,
Joy- joy, enjoy
Those need. Indeed
We scared with money,
Fun and fun—so funny
Come and be liberal
Nourish and cherish
The living skeleton
Drought on body
Skinny, bone thorny
Just living,
Just breathing,
Just waiting,
Became a decoy,
Joy- joy, enjoy; yeah,
Joy- joy, enjoy
Lord is ashamed on us with our act,
Fooling the Lord, no prayer in fact

Joy! shipmate--joy!
(Pleas'd to my Soul at death I cry;)
Our life is closed--our life begins;
The long, long anchorage we leave,
The ship is clear at last--she leaps!
She swiftly courses from the shore;
Joy! shipmate--joy!

Good morning Mr Magpie
alone again, like me
I greet you then I bless myself
and hope that I shall see
your lady busy in the trees
up here in Jagger Green.
The wind is soft and urgent
on the pale green Yorkshire hills
rooks fuss in high bare branches
looking down on silent mills
and the magpie is a single bird
up here in Jagger Green.
I watched him as he rested
in the Mayday morning light
then hard and low and straight there came
another flash of black and white
and the sun is like a woman's kiss
up here in Jagger Green.

The greatest joy on earth is our children;
To see them born healthy and grow up well;
To see them acquire God's precious ken,
That guides them to Heaven, avoiding hell.
What joy it is to see them walk on fours!
And learn to move, to utter sounds with sense;
What joy it is to hear their mental stores!
To see them worldly-wise, avoid non-sense.
What, joy to see the child, Father of man!
What joy to see them outdo their parents!
What joy when things we cannot do, they can!
What joy to see their God-given talents?
Our children are the apples of our eyes;
The Almighty God, we see, in their guise.

One of the things that I'm most proud of
Since I was very young
Is learning to cook and enjoying it so
And what a pleasure it has become
It started with egg sandwiches for Dad
He liked one when he wanted a snack
He said mine were the best that could be had
I was proud to do something back
Then there was the apples pies I baked
One day when mom was out
And to my joy, the crust turned out great!
And my love of cooking came about
Mom taught me to season everything just right
And all the tips she knew
The soups and gravies, and cakes so lite
The cassaroles and the irish stew
Then I was making dinner for the family
My four brothers, mom and dad, and me
And at fourteen years old I was hired to cook
For the neighbor with seven kids to feed!
Later when I got a place on my own
I couldn't afford to go out to eat
I could barely afford to pay the rent!
I was broke, but I ate like a queen!
I've fed all my family and friends that I know
And catered parties and festivals too
And the joy that I feel can't help but show
I love to nurture people with food!
We must all nourish our bodies each day
So why not make it taste great!
With a little planning, a will, and a way
The skies the limit on what we can make!
The joy of cooking is something learned and shared
And it unites the young and the old
A lifelong love that can only be compared
To a treasure more precious than gold!

What joy has filled my empty heart
For so long starved of love,
My spirit floating through the air
And on the clouds above.
What joy has come to me at last
When all my hope had gone,
For finally my luck has changed
And fortune now has shone.
What joy when all I had was lost
Alone and poor was I,
But now my future seems so clear
Just like the summer sky.
What joy has filled my empty heart
Now it does sing for thee,
The love for which I'd waited long
Shall last eternally.

The unfair injury burdened upon the shoulders of the African men and women.
The echoes of slavery constantly overshadows America’s path to the future.
Memories of yesterdays gone; times that we hope will never return again.
The cries from the hurt, forced, chained and scared treading waters to places untold.
Tossed up and down upon the waves in the belly of the smelly wooden beast,
Chained up together and stacked so tight, there is no more hope for a safe retreat.
Longing and hoping for just a few moments of quietness and rest to escape.
Quietly yearning for the days past before this humiliating enslavement of defeat.
The dreadful hours turn into days; then suddenly followed by weeks and months.
The stench of former kings and queens mingles with the rotten flesh of the dead.
The useless cargo is buried without ceremony into the darkness of the deep sea.
Days later, the wooden beast unloads its scared cargo and is paid for each live head.
The dark skinned children of Africa forced to survive upon a distant hateful land.
Slaves nightly beaten until just can not take any more so quickly submit instead.
Fed like hogs; treated worse than dogs, force to sleep with the master or the wife.
If not obedient, the slave might be starved, beaten or have a bullet put in the head.
Oh, the scars run so deep through many descendants of the former kings and queens.
Forced to survive and fend for themselves; their forced servitude no longer is needed.
Required to hide in the dark backwoods of society like a secret no one wanted to be told.
Bowing and scraping just so Mr. Johnnie will feel good and hoping not to be mistreated.
Life off the plantation, faced with the promises of reconciliation never to be delivered.
It was just a lie to make them feel good about their wrongs committed to the African.
Promises made were quickly broken and any hope for equality was chased quickly away.
The seeds of the American slave should not speak up for fear of the dread white man’s hand.
Time progressed as the dreaded years turned into frightening decades of a different century.
Multitudes died as racist countrymen hunted them down just because they wanted the right to vote.
Politicians and preachers stood idle while the children of African-American slaves were hunted down.
Some were brave enough to speak the truth; he got shot and she ended up dangling from the end of a rope.
Decades later, things misleadingly seem to have changed a little except the plantation has gotten bigger.
No longer shipped over on the wooden beast; can forget freezing inside the plantation cold, battered shed.
Life has become more complicated, the necessity has now made every American an unwilling slave.
Working hard hoping to make the American dream come true then the job relocates oversees instead.
Today, no work, crime is rising and no one is living well on the great American corporate plantation.
The greed of the masters overshadows the prosperity dreamed of as new slaves willingly came ashore.
To be ground like meat for sausage some sold their very soul on the auction block of aspiration.
Only to sadly realize they are really slaves when instead of losing profit, they are often shown the door.
The unfair injury once burdened upon the shoulders of the African men and women.
The echoes of a slave's past rapidly overtakes America’s path to the unsure future.
Memories of yesterdays gone; prosperous times that we hope will somehow return again.
The past crimes done, now, cry out for justice because the need for reconciliation still exists.

Thou hast no lightnings, O thou Just!
Or I their force should know;
And, if thou strike me into dust,
My soul approves the blow.
The heart, that values less its ease
Than it adores thy ways,
In thine avenging anger sees
A subject of its praise.
Pleased I could lie, concealed and lost,
In shades of central night;
Not to avoid thy wrath, thou know'st,
But lest I grieve thy sight.
Smite me, O thou, whom I provoke!
And I will love thee still:
The well deserved and righteous stroke
Shall please me, though it kill.
Am I not worthy to sustain
The worst thou canst devise;
And dare I seek thy throne again,
And meet thy sacred eyes?
Far from afflicting, thou art kind;
And, in my saddest hours,
An unction of thy grace I find,
Pervading all my powers.
Alas! thou sparest me yet again;
And, when thy wrath should move,
Too gentle to endure my pain,
Thou soothest me with thy love.
I have no punishment to fear;
But, ah! that smile from thee
Imparts a pang far more severe
Than woe itself would be.

Is capital punishment justice or is it revenge?
This is the question that I want to defend.
Is it really justice if you have to kill someone?
Or is the killing of a being just for your fun?
Is a murder really justified if the culprit spends less time in jail?
If so then it seems capital punishment is just easy bail.
They should be punished and not given an out of jail card,
All capital punishment is doing is spending money, cold and hard.
Wanting them to die doesn’t seem like justice but revenge?
It leaves blood on your hands when there life ends.
Life is full of trials and tribulations this is a must,
But if you kill a man then it won’t make life any more just.
Justice is using authority to give a fair decree,
But intended death to a being doesn’t seem fair to me.
Revenge is to satisfy in retaliation,
But death’s your one hit wonder, one satisfaction.
So I will always choose the criminals to defend,
Leaving you with your decision: justice or revenge?

i spit hammers and nails,
can taste bullets and swords.
my eyes are the bodies
of the innocent that lay dying.
my fingers touch the ribs
of small children starving.
my tongue's made of coal dust,
oil, and death by profit!
my ears hear the cry of freedom
from the cells of the oppressor.
my heart sleeps neath the bridge
with the homeless family at night.
my fists smash the lie and the liar both,
my arms carry the weight
of the working class's lives.
covered with the stink of poverty,
i shed the clothes of pretensions,
apathy, and human greed.
and my desire grows hard
when i see a better day...
my back bears the stripes
of man's mistakes and failures...
i cry justice, i am equality,
i breathe compassion, i am human!

In the recesses
of a creased mind
lies the truth
of what is right
In the land
of truth and justice
lies broken dreams
where justice was not seen
Let us see

Huts of childhood are in autumn,
Decayed hamlet; dark shapes,
Singing mothers in the evening wind;
At windows Angelus and hands fold.
Still birth; on green ground
Mystery and stillness of blue flowers.
Insanity opens the purple mouth:
Dies irae - grave and stillness.
Groping along green thorns;
In the sleep: blood-vomit, hunger and laughter;
Fire in the village, awakening in the green;
Fear and swaying on gurgling boat.
Or in wooden staircase again
The white shadow of the strange woman leans.-
Poor sinner longing away in the blueness
Left his putrefaction behind for lilies and rats.

A shimmering light
in the distance of my life
keeps calling me home
I can hear the humming
of the electric current
calling my name
Telling me to make sure
Justice is done

There is a law which guarantees
that as you sow so shall you reap,
there’s no point in not guilty pleas.
The record keeper never sleeps.
That which you give you will receive.
The correct balance must be kept
just simple justice I believe.
You have no choice you must accept
The punishment that you deserve.
Forget the lies you have been taught
repenting misdeeds will not serve.
Your protestations count for nought.
The scales must balance exactly.
The  credit and the debit side,
no one is punished unjustly.
The law is equally applied.
There’s only you gives evidence
before a jury of your peers,
with wisdom and experience
to understand your hopes and fears
They will advise you that’s what they do.
About the things you need to learn
but the decisions left to you.
To choose to rest or quick return.
To start again with a clean sheet.
Another chance for you to earn
the merits needed to complete
the lessons which you need to learn.
Each life we live a step towards
a destination still unknown
Where we receive our just rewards
because we are at last full grown.

O shy maiden, cooking a time-torn dish,
You sail on high seas, always far from beach,
Ensconced in thine lofty principled niche,
When arrive, is not it too late to reach?
I feel thine conscience is still alive,
Ye show lady justice blind. But she's lame.
Stays and delays her single most ill-fame,
What good, in two decades should she arrive?
If there be wrong that whole world has well seen,
The court it seems is not satisfied still,
No crime leaves confession, nor yet signed will,
Time, justice contemplates and looks within.
A victim of justice is good as killed,
But there's one more— whole legal edifice,
And the system, with bureaucracy filled,
And true victim is the very justice.
Ye bank too much on the letter of law,
But letter's fine if it carries spirit,
Blindfolded, justice can still be in awe,
Too much process makes justice no more fit.
Thine chairs sticky seem of privileges,
Ready to threaten with contempt of court,
Lofty chairs too serve public on wages,
No one need sit in an isolate fort.
And here the courts woke up by public noise;
I wish it'd kept its own alarm warnings,
But was reposed on procedural poise,
When stirred it walked when should fly on all wings.
Let courts rid old baggage, all the vain load,
It should still run, let jagged get the rough road.
_____________________________________________ _________
The killers of Jessica Lall virtually walked away free. Let's not blame just the powerful and rich perpetrators of the crime. The real culprit here seems to be our legal and judicial system, and the law enforcers. She scarce is the only victim. The true Victim is justice itself. Victim, is our collective conscience as well, and our collective heart hardening fast.

One must not take love wrongly
A kiss may mean anything
Emotion gets physical in different ways
If planted on the head
Think of me always
Is a likely import for a kiss
Planted on the cheeks it calls
For fraternity even in strain
On the back of the hand
What other meaning than adoration
For the one beloved
Or on the feet unreserved worship indeed
It is only when a man
Kisses his wife full on the lips
That romance is exclusively expressed
They lock in passionate embrace
Tumbling to the floor
In throes of devouring passion
Making bashful sounds they will disdain
In the somberness of morning
It is not so I feel for my best friend
With him every touch
Is only a call to truer fraternity
That one heart may sincerely love the other
As unto itself.

What thing is that, nor felt nor seene
Till it bee given? a present for a Queene:
A fine conceite to give and take the like:
The giver yet is farther for to seeke;
The taker doth possesse nothing the more,
The giver hee hath nothing lesse in store:
And given once that nature hath it still,
You cannot keepe or leave it if you will:
The workmanshippe is counted very small,
The labour is esteemed naught at all:
But to conclude, this gift is such indeede,
That, if some see't 'twill make theyr hearts to bleede

Away from the night
Everyone moves across the street
To be together, far from,
They are attracted to the light
And the music the flesh makes
As it dies
Traveling away from home
A cross to where I have no eyes, intersecting without hope
And I can not see where she is, gone,
The thing that never was between us
And the flowers in the gutter leading
To the sea- before the sun rises,
The thing that never was dissolves and goes away
In tiny fragments before the sun
And her kiss imagined, always felt,
But never,
All the pleasures of the system, petals budding
From the glowing stems,
Like lines on a road,
The conduits of rushing people,
Discarding me
And I am roadkill lying dead beside
Her bed (as they make some kind of attempt at love)
And forgotten on her neck, a broken gem,
Once priceless- now trash-
In the shadows beside where all
The lives move
Dances to the lights and forgets
Neighborhoods drunken and empty, abandoned museums,
And the life flipping over in mausoleums
Pages in a book read but
Not understood, a bed of transgressions
And falsehoods made-up to hide the stains
Like the nights coming on attracting the
Insects calling our humanity, a god of weekends,
And spirits past,
Forgetting to resist the temptation,
Where my wrist lays open and waiting
For a kiss.

Kiss kiss kiss
Even if she does not posses
Angelina Jolie's luscious lips
Take her imagination to ecstasy
A place where flowers dance tango
A garden full of red and white roses
Your chapped strong lips her ticket
To the city where waterfalls sing
Kiss Kiss Kiss and make up
Make all her troubles go away
Light up your beautiful home gentleman.
Kiss Kiss Kiss
The only way to keep him
Close to your fire of passion
Put a lip gloss on your body
By the time you approach him
His eyes will be kissing and kissing
All over your smooth fine body
Be the lady of the smoking home
Kiss Kiss Kiss and make up
Take his imagination out of hardships
Worthy to be your partner kiss him.
Kiss Kiss Kiss
Respect your loving husband
Love your respectful wife.
***The Book of Passion (till death do us apart)

Sounds very Simple to do,
To Kiss me Quick
But your Love must be True
And to catch me, is the Trick
When our lips do Meet
I know it will be such a Treat
For me as well as You
Nice and wet like the Morning Dew
Lips twisting and Turning
For more defiantly Yearning
And I'll probably want a Lot
Once I have Been Caught

Skinned knees
Aching bellies
An Ankle sprain;
Mother, your one kiss was enough
To drive all the pain away
Time and again.
Depression striken
At crossroads
Groping for answers
Mother, your one kiss was enough
All dilemmas it did unchain
Time and again.
Unfulfilled promises
Soured friendship
Broken heart, ;
Mother can your kiss fix everything?
Can it mend these broken strings
Can it repair my hurt feelings?
Kiss me today mother,
Be my anchor of strength & hope.
Help me get through the onerous times
Help me handle the matters of mind and heart
Help me break away from these teenage trappings
Kiss me today mother, help me make a start.

On Helen’s heart the day were night!
But I may not adventure there:
Here breast is guarded by a right,
And she is true as fair.
And though in happy days her eyes
The glow within mine own could please,
She’s purer than the babe who cries
For empire on her knees.
Her love is for her lord and child,
And unto them belongs her snow;
But none can rob me of her wild
Young kiss of long ago!

Here we are
Again in the circle
Our lives passing
Before our eyes
Somehow we’re
On the outside
Looking in
As someone else
Lives our lives
And there—
A kiss
From me to you
Only it’s not you
And it’s not me
Bodies don’t mean
Anything
Because the souls are
Misplaced and mislead
To a faraway land
Where dreams
Mingle and dance
With reality
And it’s not me and you
That live on the inside
We found the
Outside world
Of magick and drugs
Faerie wings and trolls
A place where sex
Isn’t sex
Not teenagers speeding
Up the path
To adulthood
But souls adjacent
And molding

A room
no music
nobody within
i am out
when i am back
music
no room
Square of
music and tears
square of fear,
erected laugh and murder
The Kiss
i could see
the dagger
and the lightning
of fear
glinted on it
A dropp of tear
i heard the hiss.
A stream of blood
i remember a kiss

And beholds freakish laughter …
Hasty rhythm and creative scope,
But it is possible to appear in emptiness,
And prank disappears at once,
And the soul freezes in a cold …
But, he laughs loudly from is far, _
The deceptive visual field is dismissed...
She quickens from attracting
And beholds freakish laughter …

We dashed outside
as the sky was falling.
“Crunch...crunch...crunch! ”
chanted the snow
as our footprints
chatted to it
in a bold yellow
booted voice
and slowly a bird
wrote itself across the sky
with such careful calligraphy
& our laughter
froze
right in front of our noses.
*******
OH SNOW!
(For Scarlett)
One day
the snow
popped its head
‘round the door
asked if it could stay
a week or maybe more.
Our smiles
said “Sure! ”
In & out
out & in
we lived
in its whiteness
until my feet
as if they weren’t part of me no more
demanded to come in
dreaming now of a roaring fire.
Flames! Flames!
I stuck my feet
in front of the fire
preferring chilblains to frostbite
but the snow
kept on calling for me.
“Come out...come out...jump about
in me! ”
I put my feet in my wellies
sent them out
to tramp about
in the fields of memory
but I kept
the rest of me
inside
hugging the fire
cuddling it
as it cuddled me.
A survivor
of my first ever remembered snow
that falls forever
over & over
as it remembers
me.

I believe, in placing ones family first.
I believe that many successful people,
leave in their path, countless orphans
of success.
I believe, when the sickness is sadness,
laughter is the cure.
I believe, that a good work ethic, can
serve all of us well.
I believe in good wine and good friends.
I believe, in a time each day, to give thanks.
I believe in forgiveness.
I believe, if one can forgive a friend,
then surely, one can forgive family.
I believe in the power of the written word.
I still believe in hand written letters.
I believe the first cup of coffee in the
morning, is the best.

People may not be laughing
All the way to the banks,
But going by SMS AND JOKES,
Still some have humour intact.
What if many have closed shop
And filed for bankruptcy,
As they are on the verge
Of going broke and hungry.
All streets-Wall or Dalal-
Bears are roaming freely
Its there day out-
Bulls have retreated meekly.
Who are Lehman Brothers?
What’s all the fuss about?
Are they fighting over property
Is it a family feud?
Your Standard has become Poor,
you are rightly feling Moody and blue,
and baffled left wondering
how come no one had a clue.
Pink slips and pay cuts
Are handed everyday.
All you can do is to
Keep calm and pray.
Well fellows, it’s time
To deeply  ponder and reflect,
And ensure now that
Every penny is well spent.
Simple living and high thinking
Is gaining on the popularity charts.
Staying afloat in tough times
Is no less than a survival art.
How about giving a miss to the Malls
And looking for a past time,
Other than drooling at dressed windows
For no reason or rhyme.
Every difficulty is an opportunity,
(THE WISE SAY)     in disguise.
Put away those swanky cars,
Don’t feel so demoralised.
Walk to work if you still have one
Shed all that extra weight.
And look like million bucks,
As a bonus you will have a clear head.
The roads will be
Free of traffic snarls and cars,
Pollution will come down
Bust goes the business of oxygen bars.
Everything happens for a reason,
Oft I have heard it mentioned.
Till people realise what is unnecessary consumption,
Long live the  bears and the recession.

Laughter sort o' settles breakfast better than digestive pills;
Found it, somehow in my travels, cure for every sort of ills;
When the hired help have riled me with their slipshod, careless ways,
An' I'm bilin' mad an' cussin' an' my temper's all ablaze,
If the calf gets me to laughin' while they're teachin' him to feed
Pretty soon I'm feelin' better, 'cause I've found the cure I need.
Like to start the day with laughter; when I've had a peaceful night,
An' can greet the sun all smilin', that day's goin' to be all right.
But there's nothing goes to suit me, when my system's full of bile;
Even horses quit their pullin' when the driver doesn't smile,
But they'll buckle to the traces when they hear a glad giddap,
Just as though they like to labor for a cheerful kind o' chap.
Laughter keeps me strong an' healthy. You can bet I'm all run down,
Fit for doctor folks an' nurses when I cannot shake my frown.
Found in farmin' laughter's useful, good for sheep an' cows an' goats;
When I've laughed my way through summer, reap the biggest crop of oats.
Laughter's good for any business, leastwise so it seems to me
Never knew a smilin' feller but was busy as could be.
Sometimes sit an' think about it, ponderin' on the ways of life,
Wonderin' why mortals gladly face the toil an care an' strife,
Then I come to this conclusion—take it now for what it's worth
It's the joy of laughter keeps us plodding on this stretch of earth.
Men the fun o' life are seeking—that's the reason for the calf
Spillin' mash upon his keeper—men are hungry for a laugh.

Laughter makes merry—
It’s good for your health.
And pausing to laugh
Brings “physical' wealth.
It releases endorphins
(Stored in the brain) ,
And builds up cells
To combat the pain.
So when life bites
And problems sting,
Open up your heart
And let laughter ring.
© 2009

Laughter is the best medicine for your blues
All sadness and worries you can say adieu
Whether you’re rich or poor it will work for you
From morning to evening it will see you thru

The other day I had had, The smell of spellbound emitted from her love, That made me sorrowful and as a dead man later on, But the blooming flowers were laughing and told at last- 'You  are in a state of being intoxicated...try to get out of obsession.'
My question was to them-
Do you know that scientist Einstein were fall in love too?
They again laugh and laugh, Meaningless laughter.
I was inflamed and so shouted- 'stop your laughter, You are  emitting illusions too, I know.

When the laughter stops
~
And what when the laughter stops
Do we care to ask
Those clowns and entertainers
Once the curtain has fallen
Is there still joy, rhapsody
Or the emptiness of a still room
Do they cry or call for help
What happens when the laughter stops
It's not a question I hear often
But is a relevant as the time of day
Were the world indeed a stage
And we each designated a role to play
Those jesters how we love them so
In their masks and acts
What happens when the laughter stops
Still we do not ask

He was given a life
A life devoid of life
He lives just to live
He breathes just to live.
A life anchored to pain
Suffering and total disdain
A life born into poverty
And stays in poverty
Is he in hell or purgatory?
Is he born just to die?
Who will free him
From this bondage
Of total nothingness?
He glimpsed at the horizon
He saw a dying moon
Dark clouds like cobra
Ready to snap his life.
Is he born just to die?
If this is his fate
I hope he will inherit
The Kingdom of God.

FULL of life, now, compact, visible,
I, forty years old the Eighty-third Year of The States,
To one a century hence, or any number of centuries hence,
To you, yet unborn, these, seeking you.
When you read these, I, that was visible, am become invisible;
Now it is you, compact, visible, realizing my poems, seeking me;
Fancying how happy you were, if I could be with you, and become your
comrade;
Be it as if I were with you. (Be not too certain but I am now with
you.)

He wakes, who never thought to wake again,
Who held the end was Death.  He opens eyes
Slowly, to one long livid oozing plain
Closed down by the strange eyeless heavens.  He lies;
And waits; and once in timeless sick surmise
Through the dead air heaves up an unknown hand,
Like a dry branch.  No life is in that land,
Himself not lives, but is a thing that cries;
An unmeaning point upon the mud; a speck
Of moveless horror; an Immortal One
Cleansed of the world, sentient and dead; a fly
Fast-stuck in grey sweat on a corpse's neck.
I thought when love for you died, I should die.
It's dead.  Alone, most strangely, I live on.

Life is no life
Tuesday,12th March 2019
I feel no different
when present
about Almighty's (Allah's)world
something new unfolds
it comes out in the form of verses
and I make no miss
look at the stars in the sky
and weave it nicely with an earnest try
I am always thankful
for making me faithful
to the cause of poetry
and sing it or present it wonderfully
I see it as an opportunity
to sing and praise His name in the name of humanity
to grant us blessings
and make us well human beings
I shall continue to sing
and try to bring
the good name for mankind
and always find the place in their heart
life is no life
if we run away from the torn strife
I shall remain among poor
and never harbor an ill wish for the neighbor

Where there is life there is love
Where there is love there is life
Life and love are like pigeon and dove
Love and life are like husband and wife A child when born
Can not survive on his own
Has to be nourished
Has to be nursed
Has to be wrought up
Has to be brought up
This has to be done
For human race to go on
Only love sees this through
Those who fail to offer fall through Life is about nature
We are all part of its pasture
The pasture is too precious and beautiful
To be destroyed by a handful We should all strive
For joyful life
We must all unite
For peace and happiness to ignite

Life is too short to be spent
griping about the past,
things you don't have,
places you haven't seen,
things you haven't done.
Life is too short to be spent
holding grievances against another,
finding fault in your brother,
counting the wrongs done on you.
Life is just long enough
to enjoy the beauty of a sunrise
the smell of wet earth
and the sound of laughter
after a long day's work.
Life is just long enough
to practice compassion and generosity,
to comfort the grieving,
to lend strength to the fainthearted,
and direction to the lost.

One life to live one life to love
Cherish the good disregard the bad
Good or bad, take it as a learning experience and move on in life
Both the experience has to be shielded and accepted as souvenir
Utilize bad experiences to improve today
Treasure good experiences for better tomorrow
And escort the life with confidence, honesty and pride
One life to live one life to love
Cherish the good disregard the bad
Happiness or Sorrow either cannot be borrowed
Life is incomplete without each other and both cannot be ignored
Both brings you different flavors and taste to life
Happiness keeps you sweet, Sorrow keep you human
Taste the life with varieties and not to be narrowed
One life to live one life to love
Cherish the good disregard the bad
Life is wonderful gift bestowed by god and honored by nature
Has to be respected and believed by every human and creature
Everyone’s role are defined and are here with the purpose, decided by creator
Educate the life on the laws of god and the laws of nature
Imbibe these laws of life by choosing god and nature as a tutor
In no way, one should violate the laws made by god and nature, rather then desiring to be a pauper
One life to live one life to love
Cherish the good disregard the bad
Live life with honesty, with purpose, with determination and pride
Live life with Joy, with happiness, with good values and principles
Live life to the fullest but within the laws of the god and the nature
Your existence should be respected and honored for all the good work you render or did for self, family, friends & for the rest of the world during your tenure and the stay on this earth in this life.
Your exit should be without any guilt and you should die with peace, smile and satisfaction.
No one can outturn their destiny
Think good, Do good and Be good, rest live it up to the god to decide
One life to live one life to love
Cherish the good disregard the bad

The lost boyhood and the lost teen age,
Roaming on a bicycle in a small town,
That wasn’t completely electrified,
Windy evenings of summer vacation,
Standing at a cigarette and beetle shop,
Greedy of watching pretty teen aged girls,
Engaged in shopping and sometimes having a look,
On the boys’ penetrating eyes,
Smiling slightly and turning their backs,
Towards the Romeos, even more pleased,
To have a nicer view of turning beauties,
Difficult to decide whether a girl in a particular age,
Appears more beautiful from the front or from the rear,
Coming back home satisfied, content and peaceful,
Sleeping below the open sky, starring at the moon,
Guessing the time with the help of stars,
The inviting heavy eye lids to a land of dreams,
Whereat those girls with fairy wings,
With guitars in their hands and semitransparent milky dress,
Singing, dancing the song of future,
A future that is yet a dream of the world,
Used to come in the bluish dreams,
Interrupted by a sudden downpour,
Quickly removing the bed to verandah,
To enjoy a truly wet cloudy night,
What a life it was!
Could it come back! !
Awaking in a bedroom and watching the ceiling fan,
Appearing as enemy’s bomber in a blue zero power bulb,
Reminding the threats of growing weapons,
Reminding the threats of a nuclear war,
Reminding the threats of growing population,
Reminding the threats of scarcity of water,
Reminding the threats of shortage of energy,
Reminding the threats of shortage of resources,
Where has gone the taste of vegetables,
Grown with the help of natural fertilizers,
Where has gone tolerance of religions we believe,
Why cruel nationalism has infected the loving human heart,
Thanks to the man in the mosque who’s calling,
Getup old man and wash your dirty body,
Proceed to the mosque and try to clean,
The poisoned brain, the seat of your soul!
What a life that was!
What a life is it! !

Tie the strings to my life, my Lord,
Then I am ready to go!
Just a look at the horses --
Rapid! That will do!
Put me in on the firmest side,
So I shall never fall;
For we must ride to the Judgment,
And it's partly down hill.
But never I mind the bridges,
And never I mind the sea;
Held fast in everlasting race
By my own choice and thee.
Good-by to the life I used to lives,
And the world I used to know;
And kiss the hills for me, just once;
Now I am ready to go!

There is a street in every town that owns a house
called lonely. Then when your just passing by you might
just say, 'if only.
If only could mean a life time of thoughts but it does'nt cure
a lonely house and all its faults.
Boarded up windows and tiles gone from the roof, graffiti
painted by a rebelious youth.
Such a lonely house and an oh such a tired one,
one that has lost all it's fun.
Stairs and rafters all gone to pot all that is left
is wood worm and dry rot.
No children playing in the garden, it's just a house condemend
by the council without no pardon. Poor lonely house someones
forgotton dream, now describing lifes social scene.
This lonely house stands in the way because their building
a By Pass or a new motorway.
The house called lonely could be any where, in the town, the
country or city square.
Even in your street there's a house called lonely just waiting
for you to say 'if only'

How bright it is on a Friday, when I am away from everything
that seems so wrong, when I am here in this haven and all the
birds are in song. It does not matter if it's winter or spring, because
I so look forward to everything.This place takes away the sadness
of life and it's memories that cut right in like a blade from a knife.
These two days a week that have become heaven to me, they
take away that distance of far gone memory.
Then when it is all over the weekend appears and so
does reality and all my fears. Then Tuesday is here again
from a weekend so long, and all the birds  are back in song.
There are pictures that I want to paint with masterly art,
but they are hidden deep within my aged heart.
My life is my fortune because I am not dead yet,
but the loneliness is there and the pattern is set.
My weekends are lonely, but I manage to cope
because I live for the days at The Centre of Hope.
I

When i don't get to hear from you
I feel so lonely
When i don't get the chance to see you
I feel so lonely
When i know you're not there
I feel so lonely
When i'm sad, there's no one to lean on to
I feel so lonely
When i'm thinking silently
I fell so lonely
There's no one that i wanna be with apart being with u
I feel so lonely
There's no one better than u
I feel so lonely
God why do i feel so lonely?
When i know i can't come to u
As anytime, whenever as i want to...?
And why do i feel so angry....
God...
I wish i was with u
Each day's been killing me
Looking at ur pics,
it brought back the memories
Shaking my head
How can i go through?
AzZ, there's no one special except u
and i just wish i could show it to u
Missing u loads

Girlfriend, I'm so lonely
I love you and you love me
Girlfriend, I'm so lonely
Please come back, N be my baby
'Repeat Once'
These are the words I cry when my girl left me
I call her, and tell,
Listen, you are my baby
No matter what, you' re # 1 lady
I went to her house, and I tried to see her
Her mom came out, told me I was a dreamer
I didn't take it as a big deal
Because she don't know that my feelings is real
Dear girl, I will love you to the end
No matter what, you will be number one girlfriend.

I’m not weeping beside lilac trees
Because of my affection for the divine aroma
Of the majestic spring,
But because of the tall goddess I fear
I never again will see.
She moves through my bittersweet memories
Which tenaciously cling
To her brown shoulder-length tresses,
Her happily excited laughter,
Her intelligent conversations,
Her pensive eyes concealing a sadness
That was never revealed to me.
Why should a man be haunted
By a beauty that was never his?
Why was my soul made so appropriately
For such lonely poetry?
The days are long and tears fall like rain
When I’m all alone at sunset.

Come, step
into my sweet, lonely little world!
Hand in hand,
We shall run across the cliffs
against which my emotions crash,
Fly through the capricious clouds
Through which my wild fancies fly,
Swim in the deep waters of the sea
in which lie buried the secrets of my heart,
Sing and dance
to the music of the swaying plants and the whistling winds,
and when weary and hungry,
eat the Forbidden Fruit.........
But perhaps you would wish to run away,
Perhaps you have your own sweet, lonely little world......
But first,
Come, step
into my sweet, lonely little world!

After a long season of heartbreak
And months of indecision,
After insufferable nights of tears
Reflecting on kisses once placed
On your gentle moonlight face,
My broken heart receives crystal clear vision:
When love has ended
And friendship wanes,
One must depart the city
Of all his shattered dreams
And find a new place
To begin again,
Unknown paths to tread
Where there is no fear
Of finding a perfumed handkerchief
You once kept
Or of running into a mutual friend
Who saw him weep
The last lonely night
He walked upon your street.

School is over. It is too hot
to walk at ease. At ease
in light frocks they walk the streets
to while the time away.
They have grown tall. They hold
pink flames in their right hands.
In white from head to foot,
with sidelong, idle look--
in yellow, floating stuff,
black sash and stockings--
touching their avid mouths
with pink sugar on a stick--
like a carnation each holds in her hand--
they mount the lonely street.

To live with a loss so great
After time of month-long waiting
Would invite such natural rage,
That a child, a babe of no age
Who was wanted and loved so much
Could die, and would leave me in so much
Pain,  if Heaven's love did not make
Plain  to me that my dear child faces
A place of tender peace, and clutching
Him tightly is Eternal Life, touchingly
Singing his lullaby needs. All praise
Be if my human heart views these ways
As right. Then I can cope, wait to see
Him again, sure he has not ceased to be.

Instantly life flashes through my mind,
It is raining, but there's not a cloud in the sky.
Succumbed by emotion,
Reality grabs my nervous system,
Like a vampire's thrusting canines,
Everything that was common is somehow misplaced,
Hiding in a dark room,
Extracting all the love inside me,
Like a needle to the vein,
As I surrender to the devastion,
My heart explodes with envy,
For the life that is now only in my dreams,
Dazed as I go through the daily routines of life,
Surreal as it all seems,
This is my reality,
With not a tear left to cry,
I sit in solitude,
Waiting,
Waiting,
Will I be able to collect all the tiny pieces of my broken heart?
Will I be able to find happiness again?
This I ponder from within the hole in which I lay,
Waiting,
Waiting,
Seeking justification,
My mouth implodes with the jargon of my remorse,
Seek comfort, I will, in the solace of my own redemption
Lay to rest the history of me becoming totally undone.

I have given this one most thought.
To learn this lesson you may not want.
But everybody knows and everybody felt
Some have seen more with the hand they've been dealt.
But I’m going to remind you because it seems.
That change is the worst enemy that deems
The fear that you have for the future
Is the loss that you will lose there?
But life is loss but not all loss comes
In the form of death or separation from
Two loves who no longer give
Each other their own life to live.
Because sometimes people have to walk away
From the hurt that they feel each day.
Sometimes people have to let go of the feelings
And move on with the day to day dealings.
Or never find themselves without remorse
And never having any recourse
Of the life that is loss and always having to carry
Those people that which they should bury.

My Loss...
Of a Mother.
Of a Friend.
Of a Queen.
The Beginning of the End...
God's Gain.
Of a Daughter.
Of the Light.
Of an Angel.
The Main Soul in His Fight.
My Love...
For My Mother.
Gods Love...
For his Child.
She's with God Right now
watching from His Almighty Cloud.

I saw her face in a painting
High cheekbones thin nose full lips
I see her now as she's fainting-struggling- wandering
Long black hair and  full hips
Loss!
It screams out at me and the memories flood
Loss!
It screams out at me and it draws my blood
Loss!
A summers day as I spy on my first beloved for the last time
I was merely 7
Loss  of Susan
Knowing for the first time that a loved one was gone
To a mystical place known as heaven
Loss of Grandma
Screaming and flooding my memory as i see the girl in the painting
I as i remember and I'm fainting
The school day when they told us our chum had died
I sighed just sighed as the schoolgirls cried
A shoe thrown under a moving car
He didn't see very far
My mom's face as she witnessed told me it all
The boy would never again play ball
Loss of Billy
There i am in the 9th grade
staring into a pair of adorable eyes
I didn't need to learn of Leukemia that way
Never saw her not smiling from ear to ear
Every single moment happy to be here
And damn she was smart
Why did god take back that heart?
Loss of Sara
I saw her face in a painting
Now i see her wandering-struggling-fainting
Why did i see her face in a painting?
There i was and there he went
The president of 50 men
Here today and gone again
Rugged, reliable, responsible, tall and then
Gone.  How his brother must've cried
Loss of Jim
Then the Rose told the tale
My college roommate who would not fail
To take his life as he had planned
Long before he met me he was damned
The sleepwalking through days and days and days
The inability to peer through the misty haze
Loss of Frank
You lose someone you love and you understand these days
When i talk about the misty haze
Loss
I saw her face in a  painting long before i ever met her
High cheekbones, thin classical nose
Full lips, full hips,
Now she's struggling- wandering- fainting
Unable to peer through the misty haze
Unable to answer my gaze
Loss of her brother
Loss
It all makes sense now
God  thank you
You kept me here to try to give her cheer
I will try i will try I will try
I owe u God that is why
You showed me her face in a painting
The painting now etched in my memory which i shall call
Loss

Loss can be good for us,
researchers say (Nolen-Hoeksema
and Davis,2002)   – it’s called
Post-Traumatic Growth…
When we ‘lose’ someone
we seldom see these days,
yet always love, we are in some strangely beautiful way
the gainers –
lose someone who, caught a glimpse of
down a school corridor, is like
a mirror in which you’ll see reflected
yourself as nothing but pure love…
and when you meet her then, it’s just as if
you meet love – and a modesty almost uncertain:
as if she had been  bestowed the awesome gift
of a part of sun and sunlight, and told,
bestow this wisely…
warmth, and light, and beautiful humility –
even your great talent – I recall
a rare and radiant press review
of a concert in the Purcell Room
where you improvised on, was it, Ravel..?
and when asked why you never built
upon that boost, you said with typical
serious thought, well people don’t seem
to be interested in that sort of thing…
so, the occasional concert; and another
undeveloped gift, for bringing together in opera
people who would never have dared
to seek the gift of singing in themselves…
so, we the gainers in this sad yet joyful way:
we saw you just occasionally; now,
as often as we remember you,
you’re here again, as love.. just, love…
my only sadness, Jennifer,
is that one day, when on your face
(never tell a lady to her face
about her face – yet I insult you
by saying that of you…)
on your face I saw the look
of a little girl who’d done her very best,
yet feared retribution…what demon,
small or large, had you to deal with in yourself?
I regretted then, not speaking out
and asking you about that; yet
you, with your great talent to bring love
were better equipped than I; too wise,
I think, not to know yourself…
for what you brought in your sweet nature –
taking work where it would offer,
playing the piano for a celebrated
but also modest ballet teacher,
playing a white grand piano next to a fern
in Heathrow’s nerve-strained hall…
what you brought was the essence of
that Indian ‘Perfect Prayer’ which so many speak
but not all live out: that nothing can be ‘taken’,
for the remainder is always perfect…
so we will mourn, or celebrate, dear Jenny:
we who were so fortunate,
and who shall remain  blessed for ever
that you have lived on earth..
‘sweet are the uses of adversity’ – for
there’s music in our souls

I loved her and lost all for her.
I lost her too and no regrets
As I have lost myself to her.
No lover regrets the loss made.

Hardest of Lifes lessons is loss,
In which having becomes without,
When complete changes to shatters,
That what was full is, just an emptiness,
And guided becomes lost.
Security of knowing, fades to a memory,
Images of Love, become dreams,
Security of touch, a sensation ebbed away,
And Loneliness becomes company.
When the weakened Heart, strengthens,
tired from the weariness, of loss,
Growing, of the last Love,
To become the strength,
Of the next.
Lesson learned, is not to Love less,
With Loss,
lesson is, to learn to Love Grander,
With Gain.

A defeat at the hand of a heavy weight
Or a defeat by a hair thin margin
Is, like success, worth remembering.
So is the aborted love to its lover.
15.05.2010

Nought loves another as itself,
Nor venerates another so,
Nor is it possible to thought
A greater than itself to know.
'And, father, how can I love you
Or any of my brothers more?
I love you like the little bird
That picks up crumbs around the door.'
The Priest sat by and heard the child;
In trembling zeal he seized his hair,
He led him by his little coat,
And all admired the priestly care.
And standing on the altar high,
'Lo, what a fiend is here! said he:
'One who sets reason up for judge
Of our most holy mystery.'
The weeping child could not be heard,
The weeping parents wept in vain:
They stripped him to his little shirt,
And bound him in an iron chain,
And burned him in a holy place
Where many had been burned before;
The weeping parents wept in vain.
Are such thing done on Albion's shore?

If you sit down at set of sun
And count the acts that you have done,
And, counting, find
One self-denying deed, one word
That eased the heart of him who heard,
One glance most kind
That fell like sunshine where it went --
Then you may count that day well spent.
But if, through all the livelong day,
You've cheered no heart, by yea or nay --
If, through it all
You've nothing done that you can trace
That brought the sunshine to one face--
No act most small
That helped some soul and nothing cost --
Then count that day as worse than lost.

Matron! the children of whose love,
Each to his grave, in youth have passed,
And now the mould is heaped above
The dearest and the last!
Bride! who dost wear the widow's veil
Before the wedding flowers are pale!
Ye deem the human heart endures
No deeper, bitterer grief than yours.
Yet there are pangs of keener wo,
Of which the sufferers never speak,
Nor to the world's cold pity show
The tears that scald the cheek,
Wrung from their eyelids by the shame
And guilt of those they shrink to name,
Whom once they loved, with cheerful will,
And love, though fallen and branded, still.
Weep, ye who sorrow for the dead,
Thus breaking hearts their pain relieve;
And graceful are the tears ye shed,
And honoured ye who grieve.
The praise of those who sleep in earth,
The pleasant memory of their worth,
The hope to meet when life is past,
Shall heal the tortured mind at last.
But ye, who for the living lost
That agony in secret bear,
Who shall with soothing words accost
The strength of your despair?
Grief for your sake is scorn for them
Whom ye lament and all condemn;
And o'er the world of spirits lies
A gloom from which ye turn your eyes.

I.
All's over, then: does truth sound bitter
As one at first believes?
Hark, 'tis the sparrows' good-night twitter
About your cottage eaves!
II.
And the leaf-buds on the vine are woolly,
I noticed that, to-day;
One day more bursts them open fully
---You know the red turns grey.
III.
To-morrow we meet the same then, dearest?
May I take your hand in mine?
Mere friends are we,---well, friends the merest
Keep much that I resign:
IV.
For each glance of the eye so bright and black,
Though I keep with heart's endeavour,---
Your voice, when you wish the snowdrops back,
Though it stay in my soul for ever!---
V.
Yet I will but say what mere friends say,
Or only a thought stronger;
I will hold your hand but as long as all may,
Or so very little longer!

Lost
As I lay down and stare at my misshapen shadow/
What I could have had/ Lost/
What I would have had/ Lost/
What I did have/Lost/
For what purpose? For the envy of my youth? No something bigger/
Something unrealistic/ something perpetually impeccable to my being/
Something Lustful, something to live for in the minute…something I didn’t need/
No drug could take the place of love/ No formula could ignite mass theories to my emptiness/ No cure could be concocted to insure my esteem to be high/
For my mind/ Lost
My Peace/ Lost
I was Lost/
Serving under something so majestic, I am not worthy/ I a sinner walking on a path to nothing/ I stand alone in my battle for peace or so in my head/ Do not criticize me, for I am human/ But I ask forgiveness, which I hope to be entitled to/ Father help me/
For my intelligence/ Lost/
My deliverance/ Lost/
My essence/ Lost/
But in god I trust and I uphold this truth /For this is a mere stepping stone in the staircase to life/ Save me Father for I am Lost/For I am living in the moment/

Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
Brought death into the World, and all our woe,
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,
Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top
Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed
In the beginning how the heavens and earth
Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill
Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed
Fast by the oracle of God, I thence
Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,
That with no middle flight intends to soar
Above th' Aonian mount, while it pursues
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.
And chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer
Before all temples th' upright heart and pure,
Instruct me, for thou know'st; thou from the first
Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread,
Dove-like sat'st brooding on the vast Abyss,
And mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark
Illumine, what is low raise and support;
That, to the height of this great argument,
I may assert Eternal Providence,
And justify the ways of God to men.
Say first--for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,
Nor the deep tract of Hell--say first what cause
Moved our grand parents, in that happy state,
Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off
From their Creator, and transgress his will
For one restraint, lords of the World besides.
Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?
Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile,
Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived
The mother of mankind, what time his pride
Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his host
Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring
To set himself in glory above his peers,
He trusted to have equalled the Most High,
If he opposed, and with ambitious aim
Against the throne and monarchy of God,
Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud,
With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power
Hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky,
With hideous ruin and combustion, down
To bottomless perdition, there to dwell
In adamantine chains and penal fire,
Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms.
Nine times the space that measures day and night
To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew,
Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf,
Confounded, though immortal. But his doom
Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes,
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay,
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.
At once, as far as Angels ken, he views
The dismal situation waste and wild.
A dungeon horrible, on all sides round,
As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames
No light; but rather darkness visible
Served only to discover sights of woe,
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all, but torture without end
Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed
With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed.
Such place Eternal Justice has prepared
For those rebellious; here their prison ordained
In utter darkness, and their portion set,
As far removed from God and light of Heaven
As from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole.
Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!
There the companions of his fall, o'erwhelmed
With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,
He soon discerns; and, weltering by his side,
One next himself in power, and next in crime,
Long after known in Palestine, and named
Beelzebub. To whom th' Arch-Enemy,
And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words
Breaking the horrid silence, thus began:--
"If thou beest he--but O how fallen! how changed
From him who, in the happy realms of light
Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine
Myriads, though bright!--if he whom mutual league,
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope
And hazard in the glorious enterprise
Joined with me once, now misery hath joined
In equal ruin; into what pit thou seest
From what height fallen: so much the stronger proved
He with his thunder; and till then who knew
The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those,
Nor what the potent Victor in his rage
Can else inflict, do I repent, or change,
Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind,
And high disdain from sense of injured merit,
That with the Mightiest raised me to contend,
And to the fierce contentions brought along
Innumerable force of Spirits armed,
That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,
His utmost power with adverse power opposed
In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven,
And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?
All is not lost--the unconquerable will,
And study of revenge, immortal hate,
And courage never to submit or yield:
And what is else not to be overcome?
That glory never shall his wrath or might
Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace
With suppliant knee, and deify his power
Who, from the terror of this arm, so late
Doubted his empire--that were low indeed;
That were an ignominy and shame beneath
This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods,
And this empyreal sybstance, cannot fail;
Since, through experience of this great event,
In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced,
We may with more successful hope resolve
To wage by force or guile eternal war,
Irreconcilable to our grand Foe,
Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy
Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven."
So spake th' apostate Angel, though in pain,
Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair;
And him thus answered soon his bold compeer:--
"O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers
That led th' embattled Seraphim to war
Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds
Fearless, endangered Heaven's perpetual King,
And put to proof his high supremacy,
Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate,
Too well I see and rue the dire event
That, with sad overthrow and foul defeat,
Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host
In horrible destruction laid thus low,
As far as Gods and heavenly Essences
Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains
Invincible, and vigour soon returns,
Though all our glory extinct, and happy state
Here swallowed up in endless misery.
But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now
Of force believe almighty, since no less
Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours)
Have left us this our spirit and strength entire,
Strongly to suffer and support our pains,
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,
Or do him mightier service as his thralls
By right of war, whate'er his business be,
Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire,
Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep?
What can it the avail though yet we feel
Strength undiminished, or eternal being
To undergo eternal punishment?"
Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-Fiend replied:--
"Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable,
Doing or suffering: but of this be sure--
To do aught good never will be our task,
But ever to do ill our sole delight,
As being the contrary to his high will
Whom we resist. If then his providence
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,
Our labour must be to pervert that end,
And out of good still to find means of evil;
Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb
His inmost counsels from their destined aim.
But see! the angry Victor hath recalled
His ministers of vengeance and pursuit
Back to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail,
Shot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid
The fiery surge that from the precipice
Of Heaven received us falling; and the thunder,
Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage,
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.
Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.
Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild,
The seat of desolation, void of light,
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend
From off the tossing of these fiery waves;
There rest, if any rest can harbour there;
And, re-assembling our afflicted powers,
Consult how we may henceforth most offend
Our enemy, our own loss how repair,
How overcome this dire calamity,
What reinforcement we may gain from hope,
If not, what resolution from despair."
Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate,
With head uplift above the wave, and eyes
That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides
Prone on the flood, extended long and large,
Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge
As whom the fables name of monstrous size,
Titanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove,
Briareos or Typhon, whom the den
By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast
Leviathan, which God of all his works
Created hugest that swim th' ocean-stream.
Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam,
The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff,
Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,
With fixed anchor in his scaly rind,
Moors by his side under the lee, while night
Invests the sea, and wished morn delays.
So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay,
Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence
Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the will
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven
Left him at large to his own dark designs,
That with reiterated crimes he might
Heap on himself damnation, while he sought
Evil to others, and enraged might see
How all his malice served but to bring forth
Infinite goodness, grace, and mercy, shewn
On Man by him seduced, but on himself
Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured.
Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool
His mighty stature; on each hand the flames
Driven backward slope their pointing spires, and,rolled
In billows, leave i' th' midst a horrid vale.
Then with expanded wings he steers his flight
Aloft, incumbent on the dusky air,
That felt unusual weight; till on dry land
He lights--if it were land that ever burned
With solid, as the lake with liquid fire,
And such appeared in hue as when the force
Of subterranean wind transprots a hill
Torn from Pelorus, or the shattered side
Of thundering Etna, whose combustible
And fuelled entrails, thence conceiving fire,
Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds,
And leave a singed bottom all involved
With stench and smoke. Such resting found the sole
Of unblest feet. Him followed his next mate;
Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood
As gods, and by their own recovered strength,
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.
"Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,"
Said then the lost Archangel, "this the seat
That we must change for Heaven?--this mournful gloom
For that celestial light? Be it so, since he
Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid
What shall be right: farthest from him is best
Whom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme
Above his equals. Farewell, happy fields,
Where joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,
Infernal world! and thou, profoundest Hell,
Receive thy new possessor--one who brings
A mind not to be changed by place or time.
The mind is its own place, and in itself
Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.
What matter where, if I be still the same,
And what I should be, all but less than he
Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least
We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:
Here we may reigh secure; and, in my choice,
To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,
Th' associates and co-partners of our loss,
Lie thus astonished on th' oblivious pool,
And call them not to share with us their part
In this unhappy mansion, or once more
With rallied arms to try what may be yet
Regained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell?"
So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub
Thus answered:--"Leader of those armies bright
Which, but th' Omnipotent, none could have foiled!
If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge
Of hope in fears and dangers--heard so oft
In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge
Of battle, when it raged, in all assaults
Their surest signal--they will soon resume
New courage and revive, though now they lie
Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire,
As we erewhile, astounded and amazed;
No wonder, fallen such a pernicious height!"
He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend
Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield,
Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round,
Behind him cast. The broad circumference
Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb
Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views
At evening, from the top of Fesole,
Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands,
Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.
His spear--to equal which the tallest pine
Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast
Of some great ammiral, were but a wand--
He walked with, to support uneasy steps
Over the burning marl, not like those steps
On Heaven's azure; and the torrid clime
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire.
Nathless he so endured, till on the beach
Of that inflamed sea he stood, and called
His legions--Angel Forms, who lay entranced
Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks
In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades
High over-arched embower; or scattered sedge
Afloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed
Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew
Busiris and his Memphian chivalry,
While with perfidious hatred they pursued
The sojourners of Goshen, who beheld
From the safe shore their floating carcases
And broken chariot-wheels. So thick bestrown,
Abject and lost, lay these, covering the flood,
Under amazement of their hideous change.
He called so loud that all the hollow deep
Of Hell resounded:--"Princes, Potentates,
Warriors, the Flower of Heaven--once yours; now lost,
If such astonishment as this can seize
Eternal Spirits! Or have ye chosen this place
After the toil of battle to repose
Your wearied virtue, for the ease you find
To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven?
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
To adore the Conqueror, who now beholds
Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood
With scattered arms and ensigns, till anon
His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern
Th' advantage, and, descending, tread us down
Thus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts
Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf?
Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!"
They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch
On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight
In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;
Yet to their General's voice they soon obeyed
Innumerable. As when the potent rod
Of Amram's son, in Egypt's evil day,
Waved round the coast, up-called a pitchy cloud
Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind,
That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung
Like Night, and darkened all the land of Nile;
So numberless were those bad Angels seen
Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell,
'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding fires;
Till, as a signal given, th' uplifted spear
Of their great Sultan waving to direct
Their course, in even balance down they light
On the firm brimstone, and fill all the plain:
A multitude like which the populous North
Poured never from her frozen loins to pass
Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous sons
Came like a deluge on the South, and spread
Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands.
Forthwith, form every squadron and each band,
The heads and leaders thither haste where stood
Their great Commander--godlike Shapes, and Forms
Excelling human; princely Dignities;
And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones,
Though on their names in Heavenly records now
Be no memorial, blotted out and rased
By their rebellion from the Books of Life.
Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve
Got them new names, till, wandering o'er the earth,
Through God's high sufferance for the trial of man,
By falsities and lies the greatest part
Of mankind they corrupted to forsake
God their Creator, and th' invisible
Glory of him that made them to transform
Oft to the image of a brute, adorned
With gay religions full of pomp and gold,
And devils to adore for deities:
Then were they known to men by various names,
And various idols through the heathen world.
Say, Muse, their names then known, who first, who last,
Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch,
At their great Emperor's call, as next in worth
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,
While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?
The chief were those who, from the pit of Hell
Roaming to seek their prey on Earth, durst fix
Their seats, long after, next the seat of God,
Their altars by his altar, gods adored
Among the nations round, and durst abide
Jehovah thundering out of Sion, throned
Between the Cherubim; yea, often placed
Within his sanctuary itself their shrines,
Abominations; and with cursed things
His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned,
And with their darkness durst affront his light.
First, Moloch, horrid king, besmeared with blood
Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears;
Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud,
Their children's cries unheard that passed through fire
To his grim idol. Him the Ammonite
Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain,
In Argob and in Basan, to the stream
Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart
Of Solomon he led by fraoud to build
His temple right against the temple of God
On that opprobrious hill, and made his grove
The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence
And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell.
Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moab's sons,
From Aroar to Nebo and the wild
Of southmost Abarim; in Hesebon
And Horonaim, Seon's real, beyond
The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines,
And Eleale to th' Asphaltic Pool:
Peor his other name, when he enticed
Israel in Sittim, on their march from Nile,
To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.
Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged
Even to that hill of scandal, by the grove
Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate,
Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.
With these came they who, from the bordering flood
Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts
Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names
Of Baalim and Ashtaroth--those male,
These feminine. For Spirits, when they please,
Can either sex assume, or both; so soft
And uncompounded is their essence pure,
Not tried or manacled with joint or limb,
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,
Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose,
Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure,
Can execute their airy purposes,
And works of love or enmity fulfil.
For those the race of Israel oft forsook
Their Living Strength, and unfrequented left
His righteous altar, bowing lowly down
To bestial gods; for which their heads as low
Bowed down in battle, sunk before the spear
Of despicable foes. With these in troop
Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians called
Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent horns;
To whose bright image nigntly by the moon
Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs;
In Sion also not unsung, where stood
Her temple on th' offensive mountain, built
By that uxorious king whose heart, though large,
Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell
To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind,
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate
In amorous ditties all a summer's day,
While smooth Adonis from his native rock
Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood
Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale
Infected Sion's daughters with like heat,
Whose wanton passions in the sacred proch
Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led,
His eye surveyed the dark idolatries
Of alienated Judah. Next came one
Who mourned in earnest, when the captive ark
Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off,
In his own temple, on the grunsel-edge,
Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers:
Dagon his name, sea-monster,upward man
And downward fish; yet had his temple high
Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast
Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,
And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.
Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat
Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks
Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.
He also against the house of God was bold:
A leper once he lost, and gained a king--
Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew
God's altar to disparage and displace
For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn
His odious offerings, and adore the gods
Whom he had vanquished. After these appeared
A crew who, under names of old renown--
Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train--
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek
Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms
Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape
Th' infection, when their borrowed gold composed
The calf in Oreb; and the rebel king
Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,
Likening his Maker to the grazed ox--
Jehovah, who, in one night, when he passed
From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke
Both her first-born and all her bleating gods.
Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
Vice for itself. To him no temple stood
Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he
In temples and at altars, when the priest
Turns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filled
With lust and violence the house of God?
In courts and palaces he also reigns,
And in luxurious cities, where the noise
Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,
And injury and outrage; and, when night
Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons
Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.
Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night
In Gibeah, when the hospitable door
Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape.
These were the prime in order and in might:
The rest were long to tell; though far renowned
Th' Ionian gods--of Javan's issue held
Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth,
Their boasted parents;--Titan, Heaven's first-born,
With his enormous brood, and birthright seized
By younger Saturn: he from mightier Jove,
His own and Rhea's son, like measure found;
So Jove usurping reigned. These, first in Crete
And Ida known, thence on the snowy top
Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air,
Their highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliff,
Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds
Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old
Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian fields,
And o'er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles.
All these and more came flocking; but with looks
Downcast and damp; yet such wherein appeared
Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost
In loss itself; which on his countenance cast
Like doubtful hue. But he, his wonted pride
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore
Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised
Their fainting courage, and dispelled their fears.
Then straight commands that, at the warlike sound
Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared
His mighty standard. That proud honour claimed
Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall:
Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled
Th' imperial ensign; which, full high advanced,
Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind,
With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed,
Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while
Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds:
At which the universal host up-sent
A shout that tore Hell's concave, and beyond
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.
All in a moment through the gloom were seen
Ten thousand banners rise into the air,
With orient colours waving: with them rose
A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms
Appeared, and serried shields in thick array
Of depth immeasurable. Anon they move
In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood
Of flutes and soft recorders--such as raised
To height of noblest temper heroes old
Arming to battle, and instead of rage
Deliberate valour breathed, firm, and unmoved
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat;
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage
With solemn touches troubled thoughts, and chase
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they,
Breathing united force with fixed thought,
Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed
Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil. And now
Advanced in view they stand--a horrid front
Of dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise
Of warriors old, with ordered spear and shield,
Awaiting what command their mighty Chief
Had to impose. He through the armed files
Darts his experienced eye, and soon traverse
The whole battalion views--their order due,
Their visages and stature as of gods;
Their number last he sums. And now his heart
Distends with pride, and, hardening in his strength,
Glories: for never, since created Man,
Met such embodied force as, named with these,
Could merit more than that small infantry
Warred on by cranes--though all the giant brood
Of Phlegra with th' heroic race were joined
That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side
Mixed with auxiliar gods; and what resounds
In fable or romance of Uther's son,
Begirt with British and Armoric knights;
And all who since, baptized or infidel,
Jousted in Aspramont, or Montalban,
Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond,
Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore
When Charlemain with all his peerage fell
By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond
Compare of mortal prowess, yet observed
Their dread Commander. He, above the rest
In shape and gesture proudly eminent,
Stood like a tower. His form had yet not lost
All her original brightness, nor appeared
Less than Archangel ruined, and th' excess
Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen
Looks through the horizontal misty air
Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the moon,
In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds
On half the nations, and with fear of change
Perplexes monarchs. Darkened so, yet shone
Above them all th' Archangel: but his face
Deep scars of thunder had intrenched, and care
Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows
Of dauntless courage, and considerate pride
Waiting revenge. Cruel his eye, but cast
Signs of remorse and passion, to behold
The fellows of his crime, the followers rather
(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned
For ever now to have their lot in pain--
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced
Of Heaven, and from eteranl splendours flung
For his revolt--yet faithful how they stood,
Their glory withered; as, when heaven's fire
Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines,
With singed top their stately growth, though bare,
Stands on the blasted heath. He now prepared
To speak; whereat their doubled ranks they bend
From wing to wing, and half enclose him round
With all his peers: attention held them mute.
Thrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn,
Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last
Words interwove with sighs found out their way:--
"O myriads of immortal Spirits! O Powers
Matchless, but with th' Almighth!--and that strife
Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,
As this place testifies, and this dire change,
Hateful to utter. But what power of mind,
Forseeing or presaging, from the depth
Of knowledge past or present, could have feared
How such united force of gods, how such
As stood like these, could ever know repulse?
For who can yet believe, though after loss,
That all these puissant legions, whose exile
Hath emptied Heaven, shall fail to re-ascend,
Self-raised, and repossess their native seat?
For me, be witness all the host of Heaven,
If counsels different, or danger shunned
By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns
Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure
Sat on his throne, upheld by old repute,
Consent or custom, and his regal state
Put forth at full, but still his strength concealed--
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own,
So as not either to provoke, or dread
New war provoked: our better part remains
To work in close design, by fraud or guile,
What force effected not; that he no less
At length from us may find, who overcomes
By force hath overcome but half his foe.
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife
There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long
Intended to create, and therein plant
A generation whom his choice regard
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven.
Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps
Our first eruption--thither, or elsewhere;
For this infernal pit shall never hold
Celestial Spirits in bondage, nor th' Abyss
Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts
Full counsel must mature. Peace is despaired;
For who can think submission? War, then, war
Open or understood, must be resolved."
He spake; and, to confirm his words, outflew
Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze
Far round illumined Hell. Highly they raged
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms
Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war,
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven.
There stood a hill not far, whose grisly top
Belched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire
Shone with a glossy scurf--undoubted sign
That in his womb was hid metallic ore,
The work of sulphur. Thither, winged with speed,
A numerous brigade hastened: as when bands
Of pioneers, with spade and pickaxe armed,
Forerun the royal camp, to trench a field,
Or cast a rampart. Mammon led them on--
Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell
From Heaven; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts
Were always downward bent, admiring more
The riches of heaven's pavement, trodden gold,
Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed
In vision beatific. By him first
Men also, and by his suggestion taught,
Ransacked the centre, and with impious hands
Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth
For treasures better hid. Soon had his crew
Opened into the hill a spacious wound,
And digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire
That riches grow in Hell; that soil may best
Deserve the precious bane. And here let those
Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell
Of Babel, and the works of Memphian kings,
Learn how their greatest monuments of fame
And strength, and art, are easily outdone
By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour
What in an age they, with incessant toil
And hands innumerable, scarce perform.
Nigh on the plain, in many cells prepared,
That underneath had veins of liquid fire
Sluiced from the lake, a second multitude
With wondrous art founded the massy ore,
Severing each kind, and scummed the bullion-dross.
A third as soon had formed within the ground
A various mould, and from the boiling cells
By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook;
As in an organ, from one blast of wind,
To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes.
Anon out of the earth a fabric huge
Rose like an exhalation, with the sound
Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet--
Built like a temple, where pilasters round
Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid
With golden architrave; nor did there want
Cornice or frieze, with bossy sculptures graven;
The roof was fretted gold. Not Babylon
Nor great Alcairo such magnificence
Equalled in all their glories, to enshrine
Belus or Serapis their gods, or seat
Their kings, when Egypt with Assyria strove
In wealth and luxury. Th' ascending pile
Stood fixed her stately height, and straight the doors,
Opening their brazen folds, discover, wide
Within, her ample spaces o'er the smooth
And level pavement: from the arched roof,
Pendent by subtle magic, many a row
Of starry lamps and blazing cressets, fed
With naptha and asphaltus, yielded light
As from a sky. The hasty multitude
Admiring entered; and the work some praise,
And some the architect. His hand was known
In Heaven by many a towered structure high,
Where sceptred Angels held their residence,
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,
Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright.
Nor was his name unheard or unadored
In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land
Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell
From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove
Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from morn
To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,
A summer's day, and with the setting sun
Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star,
On Lemnos, th' Aegaean isle. Thus they relate,
Erring; for he with this rebellious rout
Fell long before; nor aught aviled him now
To have built in Heaven high towers; nor did he scape
By all his engines, but was headlong sent,
With his industrious crew, to build in Hell.
Meanwhile the winged Heralds, by command
Of sovereign power, with awful ceremony
And trumpet's sound, throughout the host proclaim
A solemn council forthwith to be held
At Pandemonium, the high capital
Of Satan and his peers. Their summons called
From every band and squared regiment
By place or choice the worthiest: they anon
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came
Attended. All access was thronged; the gates
And porches wide, but chief the spacious hall
(Though like a covered field, where champions bold
Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldan's chair
Defied the best of Paynim chivalry
To mortal combat, or career with lance),
Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air,
Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As bees
In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides.
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive
In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers
Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank,
The suburb of their straw-built citadel,
New rubbed with balm, expatiate, and confer
Their state-affairs: so thick the airy crowd
Swarmed and were straitened; till, the signal given,
Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed
In bigness to surpass Earth's giant sons,
Now less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room
Throng numberless--like that pygmean race
Beyond the Indian mount; or faery elves,
Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side
Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,
Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon
Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth
Wheels her pale course: they, on their mirth and dance
Intent, with jocund music charm his ear;
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms
Reduced their shapes immense, and were at large,
Though without number still, amidst the hall
Of that infernal court. But far within,
And in their own dimensions like themselves,
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim
In close recess and secret conclave sat,
A thousand demi-gods on golden seats,
Frequent and full. After short silence then,
And summons read, the great consult began.

As one who in his journey bates at noon,
Though bent on speed; so here the Arch-Angel paused
Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored,
If Adam aught perhaps might interpose;
Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes.
Thus thou hast seen one world begin, and end;
And Man, as from a second stock, proceed.
Much thou hast yet to see; but I perceive
Thy mortal sight to fail; objects divine
Must needs impair and weary human sense:
Henceforth what is to come I will relate;
Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.
This second source of Men, while yet but few,
And while the dread of judgement past remains
Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity,
With some regard to what is just and right
Shall lead their lives, and multiply apace;
Labouring the soil, and reaping plenteous crop,
Corn, wine, and oil; and, from the herd or flock,
Oft sacrificing bullock, lamb, or kid,
With large wine-offerings poured, and sacred feast,
Shall spend their days in joy unblamed; and dwell
Long time in peace, by families and tribes,
Under paternal rule: till one shall rise
Of proud ambitious heart; who, not content
With fair equality, fraternal state,
Will arrogate dominion undeserved
Over his brethren, and quite dispossess
Concord and law of nature from the earth;
Hunting (and men not beasts shall be his game)
With war, and hostile snare, such as refuse
Subjection to his empire tyrannous:
A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled
Before the Lord; as in despite of Heaven,
Or from Heaven, claiming second sovranty;
And from rebellion shall derive his name,
Though of rebellion others he accuse.
He with a crew, whom like ambition joins
With him or under him to tyrannize,
Marching from Eden towards the west, shall find
The plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge
Boils out from under ground, the mouth of Hell:
Of brick, and of that stuff, they cast to build
A city and tower, whose top may reach to Heaven;
And get themselves a name; lest, far dispersed
In foreign lands, their memory be lost;
Regardless whether good or evil fame.
But God, who oft descends to visit men
Unseen, and through their habitations walks
To mark their doings, them beholding soon,
Comes down to see their city, ere the tower
Obstruct Heaven-towers, and in derision sets
Upon their tongues a various spirit, to rase
Quite out their native language; and, instead,
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud,
Among the builders; each to other calls
Not understood; till hoarse, and all in rage,
As mocked they storm: great laughter was in Heaven,
And looking down, to see the hubbub strange,
And hear the din:  Thus was the building left
Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named.
Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased.
O execrable son! so to aspire
Above his brethren; to himself assuming
Authority usurped, from God not given:
He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,
Dominion absolute; that right we hold
By his donation; but man over men
He made not lord; such title to himself
Reserving, human left from human free.
But this usurper his encroachment proud
Stays not on Man; to God his tower intends
Siege and defiance:  Wretched man!what food
Will he convey up thither, to sustain
Himself and his rash army; where thin air
Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross,
And famish him of breath, if not of bread?
To whom thus Michael.  Justly thou abhorrest
That son, who on the quiet state of men
Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue
Rational liberty; yet know withal,
Since thy original lapse, true liberty
Is lost, which always with right reason dwells
Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being:
Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed,
Immediately inordinate desires,
And upstart passions, catch the government
From reason; and to servitude reduce
Man, till then free.  Therefore, since he permits
Within himself unworthy powers to reign
Over free reason, God, in judgement just,
Subjects him from without to violent lords;
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
His outward freedom:  Tyranny must be;
Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse.
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low
From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong,
But justice, and some fatal curse annexed,
Deprives them of their outward liberty;
Their inward lost:  Witness the irreverent son
Of him who built the ark; who, for the shame
Done to his father, heard this heavy curse,
Servant of servants, on his vicious race.
Thus will this latter, as the former world,
Still tend from bad to worse; till God at last,
Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw
His presence from among them, and avert
His holy eyes; resolving from thenceforth
To leave them to their own polluted ways;
And one peculiar nation to select
From all the rest, of whom to be invoked,
A nation from one faithful man to spring:
Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,
Bred up in idol-worship:  O, that men
(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,
While yet the patriarch lived, who 'scaped the flood,
As to forsake the living God, and fall
To worship their own work in wood and stone
For Gods!  Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes
To call by vision, from his father's house,
His kindred, and false Gods, into a land
Which he will show him; and from him will raise
A mighty nation; and upon him shower
His benediction so, that in his seed
All nations shall be blest: he straight obeys;
Not knowing to what land, yet firm believes:
I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith
He leaves his Gods, his friends, and native soil,
Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the ford
To Haran; after him a cumbrous train
Of herds and flocks, and numerous servitude;
Not wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth
With God, who called him, in a land unknown.
Canaan he now attains; I see his tents
Pitched about Sechem, and the neighbouring plain
Of Moreh; there by promise he receives
Gift to his progeny of all that land,
From Hameth northward to the Desart south;
(Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed;)
From Hermon east to the great western Sea;
Mount Hermon, yonder sea; each place behold
In prospect, as I point them; on the shore
Mount Carmel; here, the double-founted stream,
Jordan, true limit eastward; but his sons
Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of hills.
This ponder, that all nations of the earth
Shall in his seed be blessed:  By that seed
Is meant thy great Deliverer, who shall bruise
The Serpent's head; whereof to thee anon
Plainlier shall be revealed.  This patriarch blest,
Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,
A son, and of his son a grand-child, leaves;
Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown:
The grandchild, with twelve sons increased, departs
From Canaan to a land hereafter called
Egypt, divided by the river Nile
See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths
Into the sea. To sojourn in that land
He comes, invited by a younger son
In time of dearth, a son whose worthy deeds
Raise him to be the second in that realm
Of Pharaoh. There he dies, and leaves his race
Growing into a nation, and now grown
Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks
To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests
Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves
Inhospitably, and kills their infant males:
Till by two brethren (these two brethren call
Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claim
His people from enthralment, they return,
With glory and spoil, back to their promised land.
But first, the lawless tyrant, who denies
To know their God, or message to regard,
Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire;
To blood unshed the rivers must be turned;
Frogs, lice, and flies, must all his palace fill
With loathed intrusion, and fill all the land;
His cattle must of rot and murren die;
Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss,
And all his people; thunder mixed with hail,
Hail mixed with fire, must rend the Egyptians sky,
And wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls;
What it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain,
A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down
Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green;
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,
Palpable darkness, and blot out three days;
Last, with one midnight stroke, all the first-born
Of Egypt must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds
The river-dragon tamed at length submits
To let his sojourners depart, and oft
Humbles his stubborn heart; but still, as ice
More hardened after thaw; till, in his rage
Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea
Swallows him with his host; but them lets pass,
As on dry land, between two crystal walls;
Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand
Divided, till his rescued gain their shore:
Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend,
Though present in his Angel; who shall go
Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire;
By day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire;
To guide them in their journey, and remove
Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues:
All night he will pursue; but his approach
Darkness defends between till morning watch;
Then through the fiery pillar, and the cloud,
God looking forth will trouble all his host,
And craze their chariot-wheels: when by command
Moses once more his potent rod extends
Over the sea; the sea his rod obeys;
On their embattled ranks the waves return,
And overwhelm their war:  The race elect
Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance
Through the wild Desart, not the readiest way;
Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed,
War terrify them inexpert, and fear
Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather
Inglorious life with servitude; for life
To noble and ignoble is more sweet
Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on.
This also shall they gain by their delay
In the wide wilderness; there they shall found
Their government, and their great senate choose
Through the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained:
God from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself
In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets' sound,
Ordain them laws; part, such as appertain
To civil justice; part, religious rites
Of sacrifice; informing them, by types
And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise
The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve
Mankind's deliverance.  But the voice of God
To mortal ear is dreadful:  They beseech
That Moses might report to them his will,
And terrour cease; he grants what they besought,
Instructed that to God is no access
Without Mediator, whose high office now
Moses in figure bears; to introduce
One greater, of whose day he shall foretel,
And all the Prophets in their age the times
Of great Messiah shall sing.  Thus, laws and rites
Established, such delight hath God in Men
Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafes
Among them to set up his tabernacle;
The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell:
By his prescript a sanctuary is framed
Of cedar, overlaid with gold; therein
An ark, and in the ark his testimony,
The records of his covenant; over these
A mercy-seat of gold, between the wings
Of two bright Cherubim; before him burn
Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing
The heavenly fires; over the tent a cloud
Shall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night;
Save when they journey, and at length they come,
Conducted by his Angel, to the land
Promised to Abraham and his seed:--The rest
Were long to tell; how many battles fought
How many kings destroyed; and kingdoms won;
Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still
A day entire, and night's due course adjourn,
Man's voice commanding, 'Sun, in Gibeon stand,
'And thou moon in the vale of Aialon,
'Till Israel overcome! so call the third
From Abraham, son of Isaac; and from him
His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.
Here Adam interposed.  O sent from Heaven,
Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things
Thou hast revealed; those chiefly, which concern
Just Abraham and his seed: now first I find
Mine eyes true-opening, and my heart much eased;
Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become
Of me and all mankind:  But now I see
His day, in whom all nations shall be blest;
Favour unmerited by me, who sought
Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.
This yet I apprehend not, why to those
Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth
So many and so various laws are given;
So many laws argue so many sins
Among them; how can God with such reside?
To whom thus Michael.  Doubt not but that sin
Will reign among them, as of thee begot;
And therefore was law given them, to evince
Their natural pravity, by stirring up
Sin against law to fight: that when they see
Law can discover sin, but not remove,
Save by those shadowy expiations weak,
The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude
Some blood more precious must be paid for Man;
Just for unjust; that, in such righteousness
To them by faith imputed, they may find
Justification towards God, and peace
Of conscience; which the law by ceremonies
Cannot appease; nor Man the mortal part
Perform; and, not performing, cannot live.
So law appears imperfect; and but given
With purpose to resign them, in full time,
Up to a better covenant; disciplined
From shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit;
From imposition of strict laws to free
Acceptance of large grace; from servile fear
To filial; works of law to works of faith.
And therefore shall not Moses, though of God
Highly beloved, being but the minister
Of law, his people into Canaan lead;
But Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call,
His name and office bearing, who shall quell
The adversary-Serpent, and bring back
Through the world's wilderness long-wandered Man
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.
Mean while they, in their earthly Canaan placed,
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins
National interrupt their publick peace,
Provoking God to raise them enemies;
From whom as oft he saves them penitent
By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom
The second, both for piety renowned
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive
Irrevocable, that his regal throne
For ever shall endure; the like shall sing
All Prophecy, that of the royal stock
Of David (so I name this king) shall rise
A Son, the Woman's seed to thee foretold,
Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust
All nations; and to kings foretold, of kings
The last; for of his reign shall be no end.
But first, a long succession must ensue;
And his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed,
The clouded ark of God, till then in tents
Wandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine.
Such follow him, as shall be registered
Part good, part bad; of bad the longer scroll;
Whose foul idolatries, and other faults
Heaped to the popular sum, will so incense
God, as to leave them, and expose their land,
Their city, his temple, and his holy ark,
With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey
To that proud city, whose high walls thou sawest
Left in confusion; Babylon thence called.
There in captivity he lets them dwell
The space of seventy years; then brings them back,
Remembering mercy, and his covenant sworn
To David, stablished as the days of Heaven.
Returned from Babylon by leave of kings
Their lords, whom God disposed, the house of God
They first re-edify; and for a while
In mean estate live moderate; till, grown
In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;
But first among the priests dissention springs,
Men who attend the altar, and should most
Endeavour peace: their strife pollution brings
Upon the temple itself: at last they seise
The scepter, and regard not David's sons;
Then lose it to a stranger, that the true
Anointed King Messiah might be born
Barred of his right; yet at his birth a star,
Unseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come;
And guides the eastern sages, who inquire
His place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold:
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells
To simple shepherds, keeping watch by night;
They gladly thither haste, and by a quire
Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung.
A virgin is his mother, but his sire
The power of the Most High:  He shall ascend
The throne hereditary, and bound his reign
With Earth's wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens.
He ceased, discerning Adam with such joy
Surcharged, as had like grief been dewed in tears,
Without the vent of words; which these he breathed.
O prophet of glad tidings, finisher
Of utmost hope! now clear I understand
What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain;
Why our great Expectation should be called
The seed of Woman:  Virgin Mother, hail,
High in the love of Heaven; yet from my loins
Thou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the Son
Of God Most High: so God with Man unites!
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise
Expect with mortal pain:  Say where and when
Their fight, what stroke shall bruise the victor's heel.
To whom thus Michael.  Dream not of their fight,
As of a duel, or the local wounds
Of head or heel:  Not therefore joins the Son
Manhood to Godhead, with more strength to foil
Thy enemy; nor so is overcome
Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise,
Disabled, not to give thee thy death's wound:
Which he, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,
Not by destroying Satan, but his works
In thee, and in thy seed:  Nor can this be,
But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,
Obedience to the law of God, imposed
On penalty of death, and suffering death;
The penalty to thy transgression due,
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:
So only can high Justice rest appaid.
The law of God exact he shall fulfil
Both by obedience and by love, though love
Alone fulfil the law; thy punishment
He shall endure, by coming in the flesh
To a reproachful life, and cursed death;
Proclaiming life to all who shall believe
In his redemption; and that his obedience,
Imputed, becomes theirs by faith; his merits
To save them, not their own, though legal, works.
For this he shall live hated, be blasphemed,
Seised on by force, judged, and to death condemned
A shameful and accursed, nailed to the cross
By his own nation; slain for bringing life:
But to the cross he nails thy enemies,
The law that is against thee, and the sins
Of all mankind, with him there crucified,
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust
In this his satisfaction; so he dies,
But soon revives; Death over him no power
Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light
Return, the stars of morn shall see him rise
Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,
Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,
His death for Man, as many as offered life
Neglect not, and the benefit embrace
By faith not void of works:  This God-like act
Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldest have died,
In sin for ever lost from life; this act
Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength,
Defeating Sin and Death, his two main arms;
And fix far deeper in his head their stings
Than temporal death shall bruise the victor's heel,
Or theirs whom he redeems; a death, like sleep,
A gentle wafting to immortal life.
Nor after resurrection shall he stay
Longer on earth, than certain times to appear
To his disciples, men who in his life
Still followed him; to them shall leave in charge
To teach all nations what of him they learned
And his salvation; them who shall believe
Baptizing in the profluent stream, the sign
Of washing them from guilt of sin to life
Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,
For death, like that which the Redeemer died.
All nations they shall teach; for, from that day,
Not only to the sons of Abraham's loins
Salvation shall be preached, but to the sons
Of Abraham's faith wherever through the world;
So in his seed all nations shall be blest.
Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend
With victory, triumphing through the air
Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise
The Serpent, prince of air, and drag in chains
Through all his realm, and there confounded leave;
Then enter into glory, and resume
His seat at God's right hand, exalted high
Above all names in Heaven; and thence shall come,
When this world's dissolution shall be ripe,
With glory and power to judge both quick and dead;
To judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward
His faithful, and receive them into bliss,
Whether in Heaven or Earth; for then the Earth
Shall all be Paradise, far happier place
Than this of Eden, and far happier days.
So spake the Arch-Angel Michael; then paused,
As at the world's great period; and our sire,
Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied.
O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense!
That all this good of evil shall produce,
And evil turn to good; more wonderful
Than that which by creation first brought forth
Light out of darkness!  Full of doubt I stand,
Whether I should repent me now of sin
By me done, and occasioned; or rejoice
Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring;
To God more glory, more good-will to Men
From God, and over wrath grace shall abound.
But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven
Must re-ascend, what will betide the few
His faithful, left among the unfaithful herd,
The enemies of truth?  Who then shall guide
His people, who defend?  Will they not deal
Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?
Be sure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven
He to his own a Comforter will send,
The promise of the Father, who shall dwell
His Spirit within them; and the law of faith,
Working through love, upon their hearts shall write,
To guide them in all truth; and also arm
With spiritual armour, able to resist
Satan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts;
What man can do against them, not afraid,
Though to the death; against such cruelties
With inward consolations recompensed,
And oft supported so as shall amaze
Their proudest persecutors:  For the Spirit,
Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends
To evangelize the nations, then on all
Baptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue
To speak all tongues, and do all miracles,
As did their Lord before them.  Thus they win
Great numbers of each nation to receive
With joy the tidings brought from Heaven:  At length
Their ministry performed, and race well run,
Their doctrine and their story written left,
They die; but in their room, as they forewarn,
Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves,
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven
To their own vile advantages shall turn
Of lucre and ambition; and the truth
With superstitions and traditions taint,
Left only in those written records pure,
Though not but by the Spirit understood.
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,
Places, and titles, and with these to join
Secular power; though feigning still to act
By spiritual, to themselves appropriating
The Spirit of God, promised alike and given
To all believers; and, from that pretence,
Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force
On every conscience; laws which none shall find
Left them inrolled, or what the Spirit within
Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then
But force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind
His consort Liberty? what, but unbuild
His living temples, built by faith to stand,
Their own faith, not another's? for, on earth,
Who against faith and conscience can be heard
Infallible? yet many will presume:
Whence heavy persecution shall arise
On all, who in the worship persevere
Of spirit and truth; the rest, far greater part,
Will deem in outward rites and specious forms
Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire
Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of faith
Rarely be found:  So shall the world go on,
To good malignant, to bad men benign;
Under her own weight groaning; till the day
Appear of respiration to the just,
And vengeance to the wicked, at return
Of him so lately promised to thy aid,
The Woman's Seed; obscurely then foretold,
Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord;
Last, in the clouds, from Heaven to be revealed
In glory of the Father, to dissolve
Satan with his perverted world; then raise
From the conflagrant mass, purged and refined,
New Heavens, new Earth, ages of endless date,
Founded in righteousness, and peace, and love;
To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss.
He ended; and thus Adam last replied.
How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,
Measured this transient world, the race of time,
Till time stand fixed!  Beyond is all abyss,
Eternity, whose end no eye can reach.
Greatly-instructed I shall hence depart;
Greatly in peace of thought; and have my fill
Of knowledge, what this vessel can contain;
Beyond which was my folly to aspire.
Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best,
And love with fear the only God; to walk
As in his presence; ever to observe
His providence; and on him sole depend,
Merciful over all his works, with good
Still overcoming evil, and by small
Accomplishing great things, by things deemed weak
Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise
By simply meek: that suffering for truth's sake
Is fortitude to highest victory,
And, to the faithful, death the gate of life;
Taught this by his example, whom I now
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.
To whom thus also the Angel last replied.
This having learned, thou hast attained the sum
Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the stars
Thou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers,
All secrets of the deep, all Nature's works,
Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea,
And all the riches of this world enjoyedst,
And all the rule, one empire; only add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith,
Add virtue, patience, temperance; add love,
By name to come called charity, the soul
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess
A Paradise within thee, happier far.--
Let us descend now therefore from this top
Of speculation; for the hour precise
Exacts our parting hence; and see!the guards,
By me encamped on yonder hill, expect
Their motion; at whose front a flaming sword,
In signal of remove, waves fiercely round:
We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;
Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed
Portending good, and all her spirits composed
To meek submission: thou, at season fit,
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard;
Chiefly what may concern her faith to know,
The great deliverance by her seed to come
(For by the Woman's seed) on all mankind:
That ye may live, which will be many days,
Both in one faith unanimous, though sad,
With cause, for evils past; yet much more cheered
With meditation on the happy end.
He ended, and they both descend the hill;
Descended, Adam to the bower, where Eve
Lay sleeping, ran before; but found her waked;
And thus with words not sad she him received.
Whence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know;
For God is also in sleep; and dreams advise,
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good
Presaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress
Wearied I fell asleep:  But now lead on;
In me is no delay; with thee to go,
Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,
Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me
Art all things under $Heaven, all places thou,
Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.
This further consolation yet secure
I carry hence; though all by me is lost,
Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed,
By me the Promised Seed shall all restore.
So spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard
Well pleased, but answered not:  For now, too nigh
The Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill
To their fixed station, all in bright array
The Cherubim descended; on the ground
Gliding meteorous, as evening-mist
Risen from a river o'er the marish glides,
And gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel
Homeward returning.  High in front advanced,
The brandished sword of God before them blazed,
Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat,
And vapour as the Libyan air adust,
Began to parch that temperate clime; whereat
In either hand the hastening Angel caught
Our lingering parents, and to the eastern gate
Led them direct, and down the cliff as fast
To the subjected plain; then disappeared.
They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld
Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,
Waved over by that flaming brand; the gate
With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms:
Some natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon;
The world was all before them, where to choose
Their place of rest, and Providence their guide:
They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,
Through Eden took their solitary way.
THE END

Spatial depths of being survive
The birth to death recurrences
Of feet dancing on earth of sand;
Vibrations of the dance survive
The sand; the sand, elect, survives
The dancer. He can find no source
Of magic adequate to bind
The sand upon his feet, his feet
Upon his dance, his dance upon
The diamond body of his being.

for my father, 1922-1944
Your face did not rot
like the others--the co-pilot,
for example, I saw him
yesterday. His face is corn-
mush: his wife and daughter,
the poor ignorant people, stare
as if he will compose soon.
He was more wronged than Job.
But your face did not rot
like the others--it grew dark,
and hard like ebony;
the features progressed in their
distinction. If I could cajole
you to come back for an evening,
down from your compulsive
orbiting, I would touch you,
read your face as Dallas,
your hoodlum gunner, now,
with the blistered eyes, reads
his braille editions. I would
touch your face as a disinterested
scholar touches an original page.
However frightening, I would
discover you, and I would not
turn you in; I would not make
you face your wife, or Dallas,
or the co-pilot, Jim. You
could return to your crazy
orbiting, and I would not try
to fully understand what
it means to you. All I know
is this: when I see you,
as I have seen you at least
once every year of my life,
spin across the wilds of the sky
like a tiny, African god,
I feel dead. I feel as if I were
the residue of a stranger's life,
that I should pursue you.
My head cocked toward the sky,
I cannot get off the ground,
and, you, passing over again,
fast, perfect, and unwilling
to tell me that you are doing
well, or that it was mistake
that placed you in that world,
and me in this; or that misfortune
placed these worlds in us.

love, oh what is love?
flowers in so many shapes and hues
giving sweetness  to butterflies and bees
in so many shapes and hues
in the field, a buzz, a joy, these insects
help create another world
another paradise, warm colourful  flower garden
for lovers of the world
help spread cheers everywhere
with the sweetness  the flowers
where the flowers are, the butterflies, the bees are
where there is love, joy spreads
wide as the field
just look at the butterflies and the bees
how they cheer up  the field with their  songs and dance

Your not here with me my love,
so I hold my pillow to my chest
and make believe its you.
I kiss it twice, just the way
we used to do.
Your not here with me my love,
but I hold my pillow very
tight, pretending that its you.
I kiss it twice just the way
we used to do.
Your not here with me my love,
but somehow I felt
you knew... exactly what I'd do.
I'd kiss it twice just the way
we used to do.
Because our love is eternal
there's nothing left to say,
except to say this one last word.
I love you more each day.

Take a look at my poem, Spontaneous Generation

In Love!
But……………………..
Not with love that dazzles and disappears,
Not with love that rejects and recedes,
Not with love that deliberates and deceives,
Not with love that demands and dominates!
I am not in love with any of these,
I am in love with ‘Love' itself!
Love that is unquestionable,
Love that is unpretentious,
Love that is unpremeditated,
Love that is unparalleled!
Yes! In love with love-
Love that is pure bliss!

LOVE IS
Always good mannered, bears up under stress
Looks for ways to be kindly, is quick to confess.
LOVE IS NOT
Ever possessive, nor needs to impress.
Not touchy, nor jealous if it seems to get less.
LOVE IS
Looking to share, and hopes for good things.
Knows no limits to taking what life sometimes brings
LOVE IS NOT
Proud or boastful, it does not feel revoked
By injuries suffered, nor is it provoked.
LOVE IS
Decent, believing, looking for good.
Contented, yet happy when misunderstood.
It's trusting, and hoping, as love always should.
Thus love begets love. It personifies God.
Lets hold  up the feelings we deem to call Love.
Comparing them close in the light of above.

call me
and I will rise
raise me
and I will love

he offered her all the treasures that she desired
if only she could put out his fire.
the fire that was in his soul
was starting to burn out of control.
but! of him she did not want any part
for she was in love with another
and this man was his brother.
his love so deep, and so profound
he let out a scream, without a sound.
seeing the way she looked at his brother
he knew then, that there would be no other.
his love for both, was so strong
that he knew, together they belonged.
so with his heart in his hand
he decided to make a plan,
to show them that they belonged together
and through marriage, their life
would be better.
now they both knew, that his
heart was broken
but! another word was never spoken.
he had shown them that his love
was strong enough, to endure the pain.
and that their love, should be the same.
unknowingly this was part of GODS plan
to see the love that he had within
given up for love of his brother.
the LORD already had a new love, on her way
and forever in his heart she would stay.
so on his brothers wedding day
a beautiful woman passed his way.
eyes so deep, hair so black
he almost caught a panic attack.
and as their eyes met, and their
hearts slowed down its pace.
he knew that it was the end of the race.
for now they both had the love they desired
and she would be the one
to put out his fire.

You said to me that you will be there on that day
but when that day came then you were not there for me
So much love showered and so many promises were made
but nothing worked on my way because you had gone
My love, I am crying for you because my love turned blue
The heaven stolen you from me and left the memories only
Though your soul vanished in the sky but my love never dies for you
I tell those angels how much I love you and care for you
and ask them to make your soul always happy till I come to you
My love, I am crying for you because my love turned blue
Looking at your photos and wish you were here with me
Crying for your endless love which become the end of story
I will not see you again but your memories will stay for ever
Now my heart fighting against a raw pain for the lost of my love
My love, I am crying for you because my love turned blue

Yet, love, mere love, is beautiful indeed
And worthy of acceptation. Fire is bright,
Let temple burn, or flax; an equal light
Leaps in the flame from cedar-plank or weed:
And love is fire. And when I say at need
I love thee
...mark!...
I love thee
--in thy sight
I stand transfigured, glorified aright,
With conscience of the new rays that proceed
Out of my face toward thine. There's nothing low
In love, when love the lowest: meanest creatures
Who love God, God accepts while loving so.
And what I
feel,
across the inferior features
Of what I
am,
doth flash itself, and show
How that great work of Love enhances Nature's.

Jealous ones get (envy)     upon a beauty,
A beauty that has swiped two souls,
One soul wiped by true love,
The other soul is snaped by lust..
Blinded souls lay in streams of hope,
Hope that breeze winded desirous cupidity,
Love scopes spirits relently in  bedevil ways,
Rays of burden burns me deep emotionally,
Emotion is deleterious upon (weepy)     hearts,
Heart is ferociously >attacked< with fake love,
Holler of vociferation utterance has left me killed...
just to give you guys a heads up
a word to everyone true love
can make you happy or sad
depends upon the person u love

I once had a secret crush
People say it must be lust
they don't know the way i blush
This man is so kind
He will really blow your mind
i think of him every night
This crush just wont leave me
and i don't really know why
Maybe one day, the feelings will be free
and i wont have you to see
I want to make him understand
the way i feel for him
I want him to be my man
I don't really want to push it
But after that really long kiss
I could no longer resist it
it is every thing i wanted
I love him so very much
But I feel I will mess up
If I tell my secret crush.
I don't know if he will understand
my love for him it real
My love for you is secret
I weep when we are apart
If I open up my heart
It would rip our friendship apart
So I'll keep my love a secret
A secret of the heart.

Introduction: Limit itself has a limit of its own…
A walk, mile after mile
In quest for my lost soul,
I had forgotten how to smile
Everything felt out of control,
I fought too hard to be worthwhile
By that I got lost in my life’s hole
The regrets for mistakes I’ve made
It took me off the edge, way too far away;
Yet I tried again so hard to get off from that shade
But got caught up in my brutal fray,
The same song keeps playing with such a vicious rage,
I find myself down to my knees, nowhere to go - So I pray
A prayer to leave the worst and move onto more,
Come off this fantasy and onto reality, to be -
Closer to something I’ve been fighting for
The touch of the light cutting through the night, it rains down upon me
As I overcome the grief and believe, recovery lies ashore,
Only three steps remain, to be fixed and free.
A lesson of value I earned from my faults -
Never push yourself off the edge,
You’ll lose the only key to the vault
A life you never had to live – It too could forever be lost,
So stay confined within the limits of the limit
As it seems - Your control over lust, only can make you complete.

She wont eat
And she can't sleep
Lonley nights
Horrid fights
Pain wahses over but scars don't heal
What you give me is what i feel
Come and hold what  you can't catch
Want to know who is best?
I will show you what to see
All you have to do is trust me
Three words of passion dont mean much
When all you want isnt love
Dont use me or bruise me
whats mine is mine
And im willing to let it shine
With what i have and what i need
It's ok when you have speed
A few times you won't rememeber
Tonight or tomorrow
Let go of your sorrow

He's just too 'touchy feely'
He gets too close to me
He gets a kiss from all the girls
From six to eighty three
But I don't think he likes me
He avoids all my advances
'Cos deep down it would be a thrill
To get a priest's romances
I'm really not that jealous
Though he never meets my gaze
Perhaps he's hoping my desire
Is just a passing phase
Perhaps I should leave well alone
As a Christian woman oughta
Instead I'll try to fix him up
With my unmarried daughter

I want your body, I want your mind
I want you with me all the time,
I pull you close, I feel a shiver
this puddle of lust, is now a river,
your lips are parted and ready for me,
our lips come close and brush gently,
I look into your eyes...you tell me your ready,
I kiss down your neck, bieng very steady,
You tell me stop teasing......but your pleasure will grow
Our loves blossoming with every touch, She's screaming with pleasures that she needed so much.
Her body writhing from the gift that has been given.
She lie there enthrawled in ecstasy, she grips my arms and kisses me,
she whispers 'better than my fantasy'
I kiss her neck and hold her tight..
and whisper back 'id hoped I'd do it right'

To feel your hands once again
To feel your warm breathe on my neck
To feel your lips on mine
To see in your eyes the longing for me
I tell myself this is the last time
For you have a commitment and so do I
In your arms each time I die
Can there be love in our lust
I will not do this again
But around you, myself I cannot trust
We know this cannot be
So stop this now before they see
But then you run your fingers through my hair
And caress my face
This is to much for me to bear
This flame we make is just to bright
It will consume us
If  we don’t stop this very night
Knowing what we have will not last
For they hold our hearts
Our future and our past
So  we kiss once more knowing this has come to its end
We can no longer be lovers
Not even friends

In my mind i capture and seduce you with the inevitable blashphemy dreams of sex
Lust at our sight dominating our control of the prudent mind,
it's so clear of what this can lead to next
your eyes gazing at me
lost at the sight of my plush red lips
overcomining ethic mentality
And you kiss me, a kiss of greed,
of wanting to endure the feeling of wanting more,
grasping the lust out of me
oh, you kiss me
your kisses like streams flowing to my neck
then to the anatomy of my breast
oh, your kisses like winter snow in mid december
descending with the rythum of my heart
and am unable to breathe my pulse unable to rest
you want me but not completly
just the love of my physical body
the nudity, the fire that burns between my legs
the lurid world hidden in my runic thoughts
so your monster can run wild with lust
then you'll leave, pretending this ever happened
this sight, this sacred dream
now of lucid exsistance with a secret scilence of a meer memory
of my breathing left unbroken.

The lust for power and money to corruption lead
And some cheat and lie to satisfy their greed
And big Corporations do not have a soul
The avarice that afflicts them their thinking control.
The distribution of wealth as ever seems so unfair
And thousands grow poorer for every new millionaire
Oil tycoons and arms dealers make millions every day
Whilst thousands are dying of hunger like flowers in decay.
To be born of poor parents is their only crime
And they look thin, old and gray though only in their prime
In refugee camps they are forced to reside
In a Land ravaged by drought and by war men destroyed.
'Tis true power can be a corruptible thing
Of the wealthy and famous some poets only sing
Why laud people who have far more than enough
When millions are homeless and have to sleep rough.
The lust for power seems to be thriving of late
And only the wealthy and famous the media celebrate
Whilst each day thousands die of hunger doesn''t life seem unfair
In a World where empathy and compassion are rare.

Meera reached the proper age,
That proposed her marriage.
Her mother was worried,
It was time, she be married.
But Meera was unconcerned,
Since she herself had married
Krishna, her dream husband.
So, she wasn’t at all worried.
They sent messengers
To other Rajput kings
With their royal message,
Proposing Meera’s marriage.
None came forward
To take her hand,
But the King of Mewar
Was willing to marry her.
Kumbha Rana was his name.
To marry her, he came.
Meera was quite upset,
And first didn’t accept.
“I can’t break our tradition
By accepting another one,
Already when I’m married
To Krishna, my husband.”
Her mother cried and said,
“My life I would have laid
With your father in the pyre,
You know, why I’m here.”
“Because of you I’m alive.
If today your father is alive,
He would’ve had it done
To our utmost satisfaction.”
“What’s not possible now,
After it you run how?
Of what’s possible,
Why can’t you now avail? ”
”Our Rajput tradition says
A grown up girl, who marries
Should serve her husband,
And die with her husband.”
Meera gave deaf ears.
She cried and shed tears.
They came to the conclusion
That Meera had gone sick then.
Doctors came to check
But they went back
Without giving any treatment,
Not knowing her ailment.
Meera’s eyes became red
As she cried and cried.
Her mother was upset
O’er her pitiable sight.
Till the last moment
Poor Meera did expect
Krishna would save her
But He disappointed her.
Here and there people walked.
About the marriage they talked.
Kumbha Rana arrived in the scene.
It was her marriage day one.
As a bride, Meera was decorated.
In Rajput style, she was dressed.
But Meera was in tears.
Her face showed fears.
Her mother said, “Meera, listen
It’s our prestige, not a fun,
Our two kingdoms, it’ll strengthen.
Rajput clan will glow and shine.”
“A mother is the first Goddess.
Next only your Krishna comes.
I’m your mother saying this.
Be bold, happy and wise.”
Meera replied, “Yes, mother
Now I obey your order
As your way is Krishna’s way.
Your word is His word this day.”
She spoke no more words.
She stepped on the dais
To hold the second hand
And accept her new husband.

In some force of nature
He reaches for her
Time and time again.
And time after time
She soothes his fevered brow,
Calms and strokes the fury in him.
A marriage of sea and shore
Embracing only one another;
And yearning for nothing more
They thrash and crash about.
The going has always been rough but
They cling to their life in one another;
Knowing separately each would die there.
But together, their dance continues
Painting a mesmorizing beauty;
Timeless and enduring
Through sunshine as well as storm.

(In the Hospital of St. John at Bruges)
MYSTERY: Catherine the bride of Christ.
She kneels, and on her hand the holy Child
Now sets the ring. Her life is hushed and mild,
Laid in God's knowledge—ever unenticed
From God, and in the end thus fitly priced.
Awe, and the music that is near her, wrought
Of angels, have possessed her eyes in thought:
Her utter joy is hers, and hath sufficed.
There is a pause while Mary Virgin turns
The leaf, and reads. With eyes on the spread book,
That damsel at her knees reads after her.
John whom He loved, and John His harbinger,
Listen and watch. Whereon soe'er thou look,
The light is starred in gems and the gold burns.

Quella stradaccia me la sò lograta:
Ma quanti passi me ce fussi fatto
Nun c'era da ottené pe gnisun patto
De potemme sposà co mi' cuggnata.
Io c'ero diventato mezzo matto,
Perché, dico, ch'edè sta baggianata
C'una sorella l'ho d'avé assaggiata
E l'antra no! nun è l'istesso piatto?
Finarmente una sera l'abbataccio
Me disse: "Fijo se ce stata coppola,
Pròvelo, e la licenza te la faccio".
"Benissimo Eccellenza", io jarisposi:
Poi curzi a casa, e, pe nu dì una stroppola,
M'incoppolai Presseda, e ssemo sposi.
English
I've worn out that damned street [1] :
But in spite of all this walking
There was no way to obtain the permission
To marry my sister-in-law.
It was driving me crazy
Because, I say, what a nonsense
That I already had a taste of one sister [2] ,
But not the other! Isn't it just the same?
Finally one evening the damned abbot
Told me: "My dear, if there has been copulation,
Prove it, and I'll give you the licence".
"Very well, Excellency", I answered:
Then I rushed home and, not to tell a lie,
I had sex with Praxedes [3] , and we got married.

Light, so low upon earth,
You send a flash to the sun.
Here is the golden close of love,
All my wooing is done.
Oh, the woods and the meadows,
Woods where we hid from the wet,
Stiles where we stay'd to be kind,
Meadows in which we met!
Light, so low in the vale
You flash and lighten afar,
For this is the golden morning of love,
And you are his morning start.
Flash, I am coming, I come,
By meadow and stile and wood,
Oh, lighten into my eyes and heart,
Into my heart and my blood!
Heart, are you great enough
For a love that never tires?
O' heart, are you great enough for love?
I have heard of thorns and briers,
Over the meadow and stiles,
Over the world to the end of it
Flash for a million miles.

'They have no more wine!' she said.
But they had enough of bread;
And the vessels by the door
Held for thirst a plenteous store:
Yes,
enough
; but Love divine
Turned the water into wine!
When should wine like water flow,
But when home two glad hearts go!
When, in sacred bondage bound,
Soul in soul hath freedom found!
Such the time when, holy sign,
Jesus turned the water wine.
Good is all the feasting then;
Good the merry words of men;
Good the laughter and the smiles;
Good the wine that grief beguiles;-
Crowning good, the Word divine
Turning water into wine!
Friends, the Master with you dwell!
Daily work this miracle!
When fair things too common grow,
Bring again their heavenly show!
Ever at your table dine,
Turning water into wine!
So at last you shall descry
All the patterns of the sky:
Earth a heaven of short abode;
Houses temples unto God;
Water-pots, to vision fine,
Brimming full of heavenly wine.

Before the marriage can been framed
the canvas has to be unrolled,
and even if the artist is unnamed
make sure the story that he’s told
has not by framing been distorted,
for it was painted without borders,
and his intention may be thwarted
imposing order on disorders.

I.
I dream of you walking at night along the streams
of the country of my birth, warm blooms and the nightsongs
of birds opening around you as you walk.
You are holding in your body the dark seed of my sleep.
II.
This comes after silence. Was it something I said
that bound me to you, some mere promise
or, worse, the fear of loneliness and death?
A man lost in the woods in the dark, I stood
still and said nothing. And then there rose in me,
like the earth's empowering brew rising
in root and branch, the words of a dream of you
I did not know I had dreamed. I was a wanderer
who feels the solace of his native land
under his feet again and moving in his blood.
I went on, blind and faithful. Where I stepped
my track was there to steady me. It was no abyss
that lay before me, but only the level ground.
III.
Sometimes our life reminds me
of a forest in which there is a graceful clearing
and in that opening a house,
an orchard and garden,
comfortable shades, and flowers
red and yellow in the sun, a pattern
made in the light for the light to return to.
The forest is mostly dark, its ways
to be made anew day after day, the dark
richer than the light and more blessed,
provided we stay brave
enough to keep on going in.
IV.
How many times have I come to you out of my head
with joy, if ever a man was,
for to approach you I have given up the light
and all directions. I come to you
lost, wholly trusting as a man who goes
into the forest unarmed. It is as though I descend
slowly earthward out of the air. I rest in peace
in you, when I arrive at last.
V.
Our bond is no little economy based on the exchange
of my love and work for yours, so much for so much
of an expendable fund. We don't know what its limits are--
that puts us in the dark. We are more together
than we know, how else could we keep on discovering
we are more together than we thought?
You are the known way leading always to the unknown,
and you are the known place to which the unknown is always
leading me back. More blessed in you than I know,
I possess nothing worthy to give you, nothing
not belittled by my saying that I possess it.
Even an hour of love is a moral predicament, a blessing
a man may be hard up to be worthy of. He can only
accept it, as a plant accepts from all the bounty of the light
enough to live, and then accepts the dark,
passing unencumbered back to the earth, as I
have fallen tine and again from the great strength
of my desire, helpless, into your arms.
VI.
What I am learning to give you is my death
to set you free of me, and me from myself
into the dark and the new light. Like the water
of a deep stream, love is always too much. We
did not make it. Though we drink till we burst
we cannot have it all, or want it all.
In its abundance it survives our thirst.
In the evening we come down to the shore
to drink our fill, and sleep, while it
flows through the regions of the dark.
It does not hold us, except we keep returning
to its rich waters thirsty. We enter,
willing to die, into the commonwealth of its joy.
VII.
I give you what is unbounded, passing from dark to dark,
containing darkness: a night of rain, an early morning.
I give you the life I have let live for the love of you:
a clump of orange-blooming weeds beside the road,
the young orchard waiting in the snow, our own life
that we have planted in the ground, as I
have planted mine in you. I give you my love for all
beautiful and honest women that you gather to yourself
again and again, and satisfy--and this poem,
no more mine than any man's who has loved a woman.

Oh! form'd by Nature, and refin'd by Art,
With charms to win, and sense to fix the heart!
By thousands sought, Clotilda, canst thou free
Thy croud of captives and descend to me?
Content in shades obscure to waste thy life,
A hidden beauty and a country wife.
O! listen while thy summers are my theme,
Ah! sooth thy partner in his waking dream!
In some small hamlet on the lonely plain,
Where Thames, through meadows, rolls his mazy train;
Or where high Windsor, thick with greens array'd,
Waves his old oaks, and spreads his ample shade,
Fancy has figur'd out our calm retreat;
Already round the visionary seat
Our limes begin to shoot, our flowers to spring,
The brooks to murmur, and the birds to sing.
Where dost thou lie, thou thinly-peopled green?
Thou nameless lawn, and village yet unseen?
Where sons, contented with their native ground,
Ne'er travell'd further than ten furlongs round;
And the tann'd peasant, and his ruddy bride,
Were born together, and together died.
Where early larks best tell the morning light,
And only Philomel disturbs the night,
'Midst gardens here my humble pile shall rise,
With sweets surrounded of ten thousand dies;
All savage where th' embroider'd gardens end,
The haunt of echoes, shall my woods ascend;
And oh! if Heaven th' ambitious thought approve,
A rill shall warble cross the gloomy grove,
A little rill, o'er pebbly beds convey'd,
Gush down the steep, and glitter through the glade.
What chearing scents those bordering banks exhale!
How loud that heifer lows from yonder vale!
That thrush how shrill! his note so clear, so high,
He drowns each feather'd minstrel of the sky.
Here let me trace beneath the purpled morn,
The deep-mouth'd beagle, and the sprightly horn;
Or lure the trout with well dissembled flies,
Or fetch the fluttering partridge from the skies.
Nor shall thy hand disdain to crop the vine,
The downy peach, or flavour'd nectarine;
Or rob the bee-hive of its golden hoard,
And bear th' unbought luxuriance to thy board.
Sometimes my books by day shall kill the hours,
While from thy needle rise the silken flowers,
And thou, by turns, to ease my feeble sight,
Resume the volume, and deceive the night.
Oh! when I mark thy twinkling eyes opprest,
Soft whispering, let me warn my love to rest;
Then watch thee, charm'd, while sleep locks every sense,
And to sweet Heaven commend thy innocence.
Thus reign'd our fathers o'er the rural fold,
Wise, hale, and honest in the days of old;
Till courts arose, where substance pays for show,
And specious joys are bought with real woe.
See Flavia's pendants, large, well-spread, and right,
The ear that wears them hears a fool each night:
Mark how the embroider'd colonel sneaks away,
To shun the withering dame that made him gay;
That knave, to gain a title, lost his fame;
That rais'd his credit by a daughter's shame;
This coxcomb's ribband cost him half his land,
And oaks, unnumber'd, bought that fool a wand.
Fond man, as all his sorrows were too few,
Acquires strange wants that nature never knew,
By midnight lamps he emulates the day,
And sleeps, perverse, the chearful suns away;
From goblets high-embost, his wine must glide,
Found his clos'd sight the gorgeous curtain slide;
Fruits ere their time to grace his pomp must rise,
And three untasted courses glut his eyes.
For this are nature's gentle calls withstood,
The voice of conscience, and the bonds of blood;
This wisdom thy reward for every pain,
And this gay glory all thy mighty gain.
Fair phantoms woo'd and scorn'd from age to age,
Since bards began to laugh, and priests to rage.
And yet, just curse on man's aspiring kind,
Prone to ambition, to example blind,
Our children's children shall our steps pursue,
And the same errours be for ever new.
Mean while in hope a guiltless country swain,
My reed with warblings chears the imagin'd plain.
Hail humble shades, where truth and silence dwell!
The noisy town and faithless court farewell!
Farewell ambition, once my darling flame!
The thirst of lucre, and the charm of fame!
In life's by-road, that winds through paths unknown,
My days, though number'd, shall be all my own.
Here shall they end, (O! might they twice begin)
And all be white the Fates intend to spin.

Hills of Annesley, bleak and barren,
Where my thoughtless childhood stray'd,
How the northern tempests, warring,
Howl above thy tufted shade!
Now no more, the hours beguiling,
Former favourite haunts I see;
Now no more my Mary smiling
Makes ye seem a heaven to me.

They mouth love's language. Gnash
The thirteen teeth
Your lean jaws grin with. Lash
Your itch and quailing, nude greed of the flesh.
Love's breath in you is stale, worded or sung,
As sour as cat's breath,
Harsh of tongue.
This grey that stares
Lies not, stark skin and bone.
Leave greasy lips their kissing. None
Will choose her what you see to mouth upon.
Dire hunger holds his hour.
Pluck forth your heart, saltblood, a fruit of tears.
Pluck and devour!

High in the sky, like a bird in the air,
One lonely kite, soars peacefully there,
A child on the ground, with a string in  hand,
Pulling ever so slightly, to keep it from sand,
With every slight dip, he tugs the kite,
To keep it flying, to keep it in flight,
High in the sky, he watches with care,
A kite in the air, he tries to keep it there,
A dad watches silently, with pride in his face,
As his little boy tries, to keep it in place,
A memory in making, a time to share,
A time in life, with love and care.

Blessed be Thou for all the joy
My soul has felt today!
O let its memory stay with me
And never pass away!
I was alone, for those I loved
Were far away from me,
The sun shone on the withered grass,
The wind blew fresh and free.
Was it the smile of early spring
That made my bosom glow?
'Twas sweet, but neither sun nor wind
Could raise my spirit so.
Was it some feeling of delight,
All vague and undefined?
No, 'twas a rapture deep and strong,
Expanding in the mind!
Was it a sanguine view of life
And all its transient bliss­-
A hope of bright prosperity?
O no, it was not this!
It was a glimpse of truth divine
Unto my spirit given
Illumined by a ray of light
That shone direct from heaven!
I felt there was a God on high
By whom all things were made.
I saw His wisdom and his power
In all his works displayed.
But most throughout the moral world
I saw his glory shine;
I saw His wisdom infinite,
His mercy all divine.
Deep secrets of his providence
In darkness long concealed
Were brought to my delighted eyes
And graciously revealed.
But while I wondered and adored
His wisdom so divine,
I did not tremble at his power,
I felt that God was mine.
I knew that my Redeemer lived,
I did not fear to die;
Full sure that I should rise again
To immortality.
I longed to view that bliss divine
Which eye hath never seen,
To see the glories of his face
Without the veil between.

Told myself today was gonna be the day
No more excuses~~I knew just what to say
Battin' my eyes, I know what to play
Ah damn, I let the moment slip away
Rackin' my brain~~goin' insane
Contemplatin' on how to let ya know
How it always goes
Losin' my nerve~~feels like I just got served!
Keep tellin' myself  I gotta find a way
Not gonna be afraid like yesterday
I'm so into you~~gotta find out if you are too
Heavy feelin' in my chest
Tryin' to represent my very best
You lookin' at me like I'm broken glass
Hands clampsed together behind your back,
Puzzled, somehow I gotta show you some real class...
Jaw drops, would ya look at that six pack!
I wanna aproach you, let you know how I feel
We had a thing once before
You haven't said one thing since I sat down on the shore
Here comes ya friend, askin' to rub me down
So I don't peel
You must not have approved
One simple glare and off he went with a snare
Finally you decide to take over
Impressing others of your ability to make me laugh
People always said we made a perfect pair!
The muzic plays our song
Instantly we both turn and look at each other
Smiles across our faces~~you offer me your hand
Brushing the sand off, you quickly took notice
My bikini was a thong!
Things went well, for the rest of the evenin'
Tomorrow I'll be back to rackin' my brain
Just gonna chill for now
Take it for what it is~~if it's still aloud.
~~~~~~~~~Ciao~~~~~~~~

You say love is this, love is that:
Poplar tassels, willow tendrils
the wind and the rain comb,
tinkle and drip, tinkle and drip--
branches drifting apart. Hagh!
Love has not even visited this country.

When I was young my heart and head were light,
And I was gay and feckless as a colt
Out in the fields, with morning in the may,
Wind on the grass, wings in the orchard bloom.
O thrilling sweet, my joy, when life was free
And all the paths led on from hawthorn-time
Across the carolling meadows into June.
But now my heart is heavy-laden. I sit
Burning my dreams away beside the fire:
For death has made me wise and bitter and strong;
And I am rich in all that I have lost.
O starshine on the fields of long-ago,
Bring me the darkness and the nightingale;
Dim wealds of vanished summer, peace of home,
And silence; and the faces of my friends.

When Faith and Love, which parted from thee never,
Had ripened thy just soul to dwell with God,
Meekly thou didst resign this earthly load
Of death, called life, which us from life doth sever.
Thy works, and alms, and all thy good endeavour,
Stayed not behind, nor in the grave were trod;
But, as Faith pointed with her golden rod,
Followed thee up to joy and bliss for ever.
Love led them on; and Faith, who knew them best
Thy handmaids, clad them o’er with purple beams
And azure wings, that up they flew so drest,
And speak the truth of thee on glorious themes
Before the Judge; who henceforth bid thee rest,
And drink thy fill of pure immortal streams.

Strange Power, I know not what thou art,
Murderer or mistress of my heart.
I know I'd rather meet the blow
Of my most unrelenting foe
Than live---as now I live---to be
Slain twenty times a day by thee.
Yet, when I would command thee hence,
Thou mockest at the vain pretence,
Murmuring in mine ear a song
Once loved, alas! forgotten long;
And on my brow I feel a kiss
That I would rather die than miss.

Your memory stays on
While you are long gone
A typical down to earth hero
As you look from up to down below
Stories of you will continue to grow and flow
Your memory stays on
They will remember you for your ups and downs
They will remember you for all the moments
You played a part and were around
Your memory stays on
You were a simple exceptional man
Making mistakes like any human
Your peak was when you took charge of football
Whilst your downfall was alcohol
The decider of your final call
Your memory stays on and will never run
Your achievement in football will always somehow return
We will miss you with each and every rising sun

The man is caught by anger
Burns all like fire,
Fire at last gets extinguished
But nothing is got
Or recovered,
So, anger is fire;
Putt off,
As soon as it starts burning things.

If you looked in the mirror
what would you see
a face full of anger and hypocrisy
would you study the eyes
with their bridge to the soul
and say there's a person
whose honesty shows
would the lines tell some story
of trouble you knew
and how you had struggled
to finally pull through
would the features combined
say there's someone who's kind
with benevolent heart
for the rest of mankind.

Mirror Mirror
On the wall
I’m telling you  my secrets
Once and for all
I really want you to see
The other side of me
Not my appearance
Somewhere behind the looks
I want you to know
That you know how I feel
You show me my expression
Everything is true
You never lie
Like most people do
Mirror Mirror
On the wall
I have no secrets
Because you know them all

If I were a galaxy in outer space
and wanted to find my reflection,
a mirror I'd seek so to peek at my face
while engaging in introspection.
Suppose I was millions of light-years away
in a constellation called Maiden
or Virgo, to use its correct sobriquet,
with a twin doppelgänger laden.
Might I query, ‘Oh mirror high in the sky,
midst linked arms and blueish trail flowing,
do you think my double is fairer than I?
What image is that you are showing?
‘Is it beauty you see gazing back at me,
mythopoeic in pondering mood? '—
Notwithstanding what seems to be harmony,
something's wrong with that calm attitude.
The peaceable aspect is masking a stage
of an astronomic collision
that began in an erstwhile earlier age
and will cause extensive revision.
In infrared, NGC five three three one
is a hundred billion times brighter,
it's said, than the luminousness of the Sun,
(hard to grasp for a starlit writer) .
A mirror speaks not, unless it is magic,
plus envisioning likenesses flipped.
What will that merger be, placid or tragic
in the redrafted galactic script?
The picture of two spirals interacting,
during a junction's coming to pass,
reveals the duo each other impacting,
thus to resemble a looking glass.
In the sequel by Carroll to Wonderland,
Alice climbs through to the other side
of the mirror, where she meets with peril and
Tweedledum and Tweedledee abide.
Yet our surroundings behave as reflector
much like the Moon with the tidal ebb.
Hence is futurity glimpsed as a specter
hither and thither weaving its web…
Humans cast shadows in all causal matters
touching on Nature's balance on Earth
fragilely wrought as a mirror that shatters.
Oh may we waken to life's true worth!

SILENCE,  THHE MIRROR POSSESSES THE POWERS OF ATTENTION
AS MUCH POWER AS THE GOLDEN HARVEST ALONG THE ROAD-SIDE UNHIDDEN
THE MIRROR SPEAKS A LANGUAGE THAT TELLS NO LIES
INFACT, THE MIRROR ENTRAPS ILLUSION AND RECAPS THE EYES
.....  LEAVING NO MYSTERIES OF WHATS BEHIND
INTUNED,  THE MIRROR FEEDS OFF THE SKY- ITS FAVORITE FEAST IS THE SUN
.....  MUNCHING, CRUNCHING, SWALLOWED, HOWEVER CONSUMED
THE MIRROR IS MORE TANTALIZING THAN ANY MOON
THE MIRROR PULLS AND REFLECTS LIKE A STORY THAT EACH AND ALL CAN RELATE
PEOPLE FRIENDLY, VERY KIND AND NEVER FAKE
THE MIRROR TELLS THE GOOD AND THE BAD, SO BE PREPARED FOR TRUTH
THATS WHY I TRUST AND LOVE MY MIRROR..... BECAUSE IT SAYS I BELONG W/ YOU
MIRROR MIRROR- koom ba ye....aka the greatest crush ever

Like any other changeling
She was waiting to transform
Waiting for her arms to curl into flaps
Waiting for another set of legs to emerge
Standing before the mirror of transformation
With the decal in the upper corner of the glass
Of  a white winged unicorn
Suddenly the thought of morphing
Frightened her a bit
As she thought of the impossibility
Of being in the ballet
Or riding on an airplane to visit her aunt
She crossed her fingers
Canceling her wish to be a unicorn
She spun three times before the magic mirror
And closed her eyes
Hoping that when she opened them
She would just be herself
And wondering as she did this
Exactly who or what she was

Because the dawn empties its pockets of our nightmares.
Because the wings of birds are dusty with fear.
Because another war has eaten its way
into the granary of stars. What can console us?
Is there so little left to love? Is belief just the poacher's
searchlight that always blinds us, and memory just
the tracer rounds of desire? Last night,
under the broken rudder of the moon, soldiers
cut a girl's finger off for the ring, then shot her and the boy
who tried to hide under a cloak of woods beyond their Kosovo
town. Listen to me, - we have become words
without meanings, rituals learned from dried
river beds and the cellars of fire-bombed houses.
Excuses flutter their wings. Another mortar round is
arriving from the hills. How long would you say
it takes despair to file down a heart?
When, this morning, you woke beside me, you were mumbling
how yesterday our words seemed to brush over the marsh
grass the way those herons planed over
a morning of ground birds panicking in their nests.
When my father left me his GI compass, telling me
it was to keep me from losing myself, I never thought
where it had led him, or would lead me. Today,
beside you, I remembered simply the way you eat
a persimmon, and thought it would be impossible for each
dropp of rain not to want to touch you. Maybe the names
of these simple objects, returning this morning
like falcons, will console us. Maybe we can love
not just within the darkness, but because of it. Ours is
the dream of the snail hoping to leave its track on the moon.
we are sending signals to worlds more distant
than what the radio astronomers can listen for, and yet-
And yet, what? Maybe your seeds of daylight will take root.
Maybe it is for you the sea lifts its shoulders to the moon,
for you the smoke of some battle takes the shape of a tree.
On your balconies of desire, in your alleyways of touch,
each object is a door opening like the luminous face of
a pocket watch. Maybe because of you the stars, too,
desire one another across their infinite,
impossible distances forever, so that it is not
unthinkable that some bird skims the narrow sky where
the sentry fires have dampened, where the soldier, stacking
guns in Death's courtyard, might look up, and remember
touching some story he carries in his pockets, a morning
like this blazing through the keyholes of history, seeing not
his enemy but those lovers, reaching for each other, reaching
towards any of us, their words splintering on the sky,
the gloves of their hearts looking for anyone's hands.

Why don’t you do it?
Why cause me pain?
Can’t you make up your mind?
Won’t you love again?
You say that you’ll do it
The love will return
The warm smell of comfort
The passion will burn
The fire within you
Will ignite again
They’ll be no holding back
No want for refrain
Your thoughts are deceitful!
Why do you lie!
One way conversation
There is no reply
Your glacier expression
Please consider it all
Think on what I’ve said
As you hang on the wall

Who is this aging woman I see in the mirror?
Who is this woman with the tear filled eyes?
Who is this woman with the broken heart?
Who is she? Is it Me?
Have I changed so much?
Has time torn apart, my happier heart?
Has time changed the skies,
from blue to grey?
Has time turned the
pain of night also to the day?
Has time worn a hole,
into the cloth of my life,
into the marrow of my soul?
Where did it go, That happy life?
Who made my soul feel this pain,
feel this strife?
Who is this woman
with the tear stained face?
She lost her heart pain took its place!
Who is this woman?

Gran father money
Father money
Mother money
Brother money
Sister money
Friends money
All moneyees are
Others only others...
Don't loves other moneys
On the way of life
Love your money...
Enjoy your money
Earn your won money...
Each every day you and others...!

Had you a choice, would you choose a
mate for money or for what the person
represents?
Your answer reveals the shallowness or
the depth of who you are.

Baby, you are soft and sleek,
Wearing cotton and linen dress,
Attiring security thread, so clear,
The soil's water mark, run over,
Who make you so authoritative?
Every human falls for your eye wink,
The colors chosen to brighten you,
Every one of you worth to be adored,
When men's sweat worth your value,
Who make you so perfect?
How many master engravers work on you,
To have the perfect portrait and border,
Are you exposed to UV lights to get burnt?
After bathing, you do go for press setting,
Everyone work on you to make your mold,
The details of dots, fine lines, design and text,
Historical images on your face,
The signature at your hips,
Tight security at your birth place,
Transferred to the destinations,
In armored vehicles,
When you go on the streets,
With the siren on and blinking,
Everyone looks at you in desperation,
The children shouts, ‘Money, Money', .

Money! money! money! “who”, needs money?
Yeah right, - ask me another question honey-
From day one, - money rules our lives.
How much we are worth, is how well we survive.
If we are born to wealth, clout, and prominence
We can be assured; the people will acknowledge our
Dominance.
However if it so happens we are born poor, we only have dreams.
Dreams to be, - to be on top of the - so-called - social hierarchy
Yes through our lives, we dream the UN - dream - able
Our dreams may even cause our minds to become unstable
Whose idea was it to initiate such a craze as money anyhow?
It sure wasn’t the Indians, for they greeted us with the word, -
“How! ”
If it were up to me, I’d rob Fort Knox, and dump the goal in
The middle of the ocean.
Without a core value for money, this would start quite a commotion
Who knows it may even be the beginning of a brand new day.
For to give, share, serve, love, - would be given every which way

money can be power
many people become inslave to the almighty dollar
it fuels an economy it ends an nation
brings pleasure to oneself
brings pain to onesself
it causes desperration and sets chains to oneself
indivduals inject the money dope into there vains
to bring them happiness but it leaves them insane
people who lack it want it
people who have it want more
money is infatuation it can bring you sex from a whore
but it blinds you from the ones you should adore
it affects brain it brings stress to your state of mind, it leaves your head with a receeded hair line
it pollutes the world because money is toxicity, it causes you to over eat and it leaves you with obesity
it can be a stab in the back a kick in the ass, it can leave you in the street wishin you were in the past
it produces greed it plants the seed of something you cant live without and something you need
it speaks every language and its never ignored, we give money to the church because they say its for the lord
thats bullshit, if in worship we are the performers, and God is the audience that we see, shouldnt worship be free?
survival of the fittest in this time people are working from 9 to 5 for the nickel dime
a cancer in society a false form piety
a fake form of religion shared by the royalty with an undying loyalty
without it you have fear of where are you going to be next year
gives you a sense of importance that you can sit but really your nothing but a piece of shit
money creates a nation that divides within a class you reside with the rules that you have to abide
before you know it you have died.
murder, genocide, for piece of paper, it comes and goes and evaporates like a vapor
its a big chip on your back its should be the number one cause of death not a heart attack
it can give a new hope if your stuck but, without it your fucked
moneys history has a beginning and a rise to fame many have died in its name
the way we grope over it we should feel ashamed
because of it my older brother is lost in its game
black mexican asian caucasian money is the form of our persuasion
maybe one day wil see that theres more to life that can be
but i know until then, i know that my life isnt free.

No man such rare parts hath, that he can swim,
If favour or occasion help not him.

Where Pyramids and temple-wrecks are piled
Confusedly on camel-coloured sands,
And the mute Arab motionlessly stands,
Like some swart god who never wept or smiled,--
I picked up mummy relics of the wild
(And sea-shells once with clutching baby hands),
And felt a wafture from old Motherlands,
And all the morning wonder of a Child
To find Sphinx-money. So the Beduin calls
Small fossils of the waste. Nay, poet's gold;
'Twill give thee entrance to those rites of old,
When hundred-gated Thebes, with storied walls,
Gleamed o'er her Plain, and vast processions rolled
To Amon-Ra through Karnak's pillared halls.

Some one else will own your property when you are dead and gone
The day you die the World won't stop life it will carry on
You've made it big, you've reached the top, you're plutocratic kind
But wealthy guy you too must die and leave your wealth behind.
You came out of your mother free of guilt and evil sin
But now you're just a money hoarder like all other greedy men,
Your dreams of wealth have all come true you are now a millionaire
But moneyed man you too will die as sure as cows wear hair.
There's nothing wrong with money without money man can't live
But in a man there must be what is known as take and give
And just like all other greedy men you never give but take
And the more money you accumulate the more you want to make.
Wealthy man don't hoard your money, don't be scared to spend a pound
Or someone else will spend it for you when your bones rest underground
Everybody hates a miser, no one loves a greedy soul
And you too will be forgotten when you're placed in earthy hole.

translated by Will Kirkland
The moon came into the forge
in her bustle of flowering nard.
The little boy stares at her, stares.
The boy is staring hard.
In the shaken air
the moon moves her amrs,
and shows lubricious and pure,
her breasts of hard tin.
"Moon, moon, moon, run!
If the gypsies come,
they will use your heart
to make white necklaces and rings."
"Let me dance, my little one.
When the gypsies come,
they'll find you on the anvil
with your lively eyes closed tight.
"Moon, moon, moon, run!
I can feelheir horses come."
"Let me be, my little one,
don't step on me, all starched and white!"
Closer comes the the horseman,
drumming on the plain.
The boy is in the forge;
his eyes are closed.
Through the olive grove
come the gypsies, dream and bronze,
their heads held high,
their hooded eyes.
Oh, how the night owl calls,
calling, calling from its tree!
The moon is climbing through the sky
with the child by the hand.
They are crying in the forge,
all the gypsies, shouting, crying.
The air is veiwing all, views all.
The air is at the viewing.

PARNELL'S FUNERAL
UNDER the Great Comedian's tomb the crowd.
A bundle of tempestuous cloud is blown
About the sky; where that is clear of cloud
Brightness remains; a brighter star shoots down;
What shudders run through all that animal blood?
What is this sacrifice? Can someone there
Recall the Cretan barb that pierced a star?
Rich foliage that the starlight glittered through,
A frenzied crowd, and where the branches sprang
A beautiful seated boy; a sacred bow;
A woman, and an arrow on a string;
A pierced boy, image of a star laid low.
That woman, the Great Mother imaging,
Cut out his heart.  Some master of design
Stamped boy and tree upon Sicilian coin.
An age is the reversal of an age:
When strangers murdered Emmet, Fitzgerald, Tone,
We lived like men that watch a painted stage.
What matter for the scene, the scene once gone:
It had not touched our lives.  But popular rage,
i{Hysterica passio} dragged this quarry down.
None shared our guilt; nor did we play a part
Upon a painted stage when we devoured his heart.
Come, fix upon me that accusing eye.
I thirst for accusation.  All that was sung.
All that was said in Ireland is a lie
Bred out of the c-ontagion of the throng,
Saving the rhyme rats hear before they die.
Leave nothing but the nothingS that belong
To this bare soul, let all men judge that can
Whether it be an animal or a man.
The rest I pass, one sentence I unsay.
Had de Valera eaten parnell's heart
No loose-lipped demagogue had won the day.
No civil rancour torn the land apart.
Had Cosgrave eaten parnell's heart, the land's
Imagination had been satisfied,
Or lacking that, government in such hands.
O'Higgins its sole statesman had not died.
Had even O'Duffy -- but I name no more --
Their school a crowd, his master solitude;
Through Jonathan Swift's clark grove he passed, and there
plucked bitter wisdom that enriched his blood.

You are the moon, dear love, and I the sea:
The tide of hope swells high within my breast,
And hides the rough dark rocks of life’s unrest
When your fond eyes smile near in perigee.
But when that loving face is turned from me,
Low falls the tide, and the grim rocks appear,
And earth’s dim coast-line seems a thing to fear.
You are the moon, dear one, and I the sea.

They sleep within. . . .
I cower to the earth, I waking, I only.
High and cold thou dreamest, O queen, high-dreaming and lonely.
We have slept too long, who can hardly win
The white one flame, and the night-long crying;
The viewless passers; the world's low sighing
With desire, with yearning,
To the fire unburning,
To the heatless fire, to the flameless ecstasy! . . .
Helpless I lie.
And around me the feet of thy watchers tread.
There is a rumour and a radiance of wings above my head,
An intolerable radiance of wings. . . .
All the earth grows fire,
White lips of desire
Brushing cool on the forehead, croon slumbrous things.
Earth fades; and the air is thrilled with ways,
Dewy paths full of comfort. And radiant bands,
The gracious presence of friendly hands,
Help the blind one, the glad one, who stumbles and strays,
Stretching wavering hands, up, up, through the praise
Of a myriad silver trumpets, through cries,
To all glory, to all gladness, to the infinite height,
To the gracious, the unmoving, the mother eyes,
And the laughter, and the lips, of light.

Full moon jags
Round this little town
Swinging low and deep
Within without a sound
Rocking through some hearts
Passing brightly by a few
Rolling house after house
Picking out quarters for
Shiny piggies and saying
Come out and taste me
Hiders trust me now
Let me return your wishes
Reflect your lustful stare
Deny your precious touches
Cover you slowly unaware

The Moon, how definite its orb!
Yet gaze again, and with a steady gaze--
'Tis there indeed,--but where is it not?--
It is suffused o'er all the sapphire Heaven,
Trees, herbage, snake-like stream, unwrinkled Lake,
Whose very murmur does of it partake
And low and close the broad smooth mountain
Is more a thing of Heaven than when
Distinct by one dim shade and yet undivided from the universal cloud
In which it towers, finite in height.

I sit here, an arch-villain of romance,
thinking about you. Gee, I'm sorry
I made you unhappy, but there was nothing
I could do about it because I have to be free.
Perhaps everything would have been different
if you had stayed at the table or asked me
to go out with you to look at the moon,
instead of getting up and leaving me alone with
her.

With a jar of wine I sit by the flowering trees.
I drink alone, and where are my friends?
Ah, the moon above looks down on me;
I call and lift my cup to his brightness.
And see, there goes my shadow before me.
Ho! We're a party of three, I say,—
Though the poor moon can't drink,
And my shadow but dances around me,
We're all friends to-night,
The drinker, the moon and the shadow.
Let our revelry be meet for the spring time!
I sing, the wild moon wanders the sky.
I dance, my shadow goes tumbling about.
While we're awake, let us join in carousal;
Only sweet drunkenness shall ever part us.
Let us pledge a friendship no mortals know,
And often hail each other at evening
Far across the vast and vaporous space!

Two statesmen met by moonlight.
Their ease was partly feigned.
They glanced about the prairie.
Their faces were constrained.
In various ways aforetime
They had misled the state,
Yet did it so politely
Their henchmen thought them great.
They sat beneath a hedge and spake
No word, but had a smoke.
A satchel passed from hand to hand.
Next day, the deadlock broke.

Theirs times that you’re not around.
Theirs times it seems like you don’t care.
Theirs times I don’t see or speak to you.
Theirs times I question you.
Theirs times I don’t even care.
Theirs times I even wish I didn’t know you.
But what would I be without you?
Would I be different or would I be the same?
Have you changed my life?
Or did I change it on my own?
Was I different before?
How come you want nothing to do with me?
You leave me in the dust whenever you have the chance.
Doesn’t seem like you care.
If you do care you have a funny way of showing it.
We use to be like best friends.
I grew up and you kicked me off to the side.
Or did I kick you off?
So many questions.
Not enough answers.
Not enough time to even ask all the questions.
My mind feels like it’s going to explode.
Not enough time in the day to even express my feelings.
Not enough time to share my thoughts.
It never seems to be the right time.
When is the right time?
Is it today or tomorrow?
When will you be there again for me?
You went away so quick I didn’t have a chance to say goodbye.
I guess drinking really got a hold of you.
Some have the will power and others don’t know how to say no.
How could you let drinking get to you?
When you have three kids.
Now two don’t even live with you.
Granted one of them is married.
But the other is still a young child.
Looks at you with disgrace.
You don’t even seem to notice.
While your family is breaking apart you just care about your glass filling up.
How do you live like that?
I know you’re not happy, so what’s bothering you?
You’ve been through a lot granted.
BUT SO HAVE I! !
Look what you’re doing to me.
What you think it doesn’t bother me?
It does but I guess that’s what blindness will do to you.
When will you notice me?
IM RIGHT HERE! !
Pick up the phone and call me sometimes.
Why do I always have to be the bigger person?
I’m supposed to be the kid.
When was I able to be a kid?
When will it be my time?
I’m always there for everyone else.
How come you can’t be there for me?
Your always trying to mess up what I accomplish.
Putting negative thoughts into my head constantly.
Do you want to see me fail?
Well I'm going to tell you right now IM NOT GOING TO FAIL! !
How come you hate me so much?
What did I do to you?
I was always the one that listened to how bad your day was?
I was the one who listened all the time
Who else was their for you?
Dad was always at work.
Sam was never home.
I was I was their.
But you don’t think about that now do you.
Since I left you don’t seem to need me anymore.
Now you have toked my friend to live with you.
But threaten her she will have to leave when she make’s a mistake.
How true are you?
You shad your tears about how much you miss me.
But do you really miss me?
Telling people lies after lies.
Why do you do what you do?
How come you act like that?
Can’t you go back to being yourself?
You’ve changed and I don’t like it.
To be honest not a lot of people like it.
But I guess whatever you want to do you will do.
But this is my time now.
Now you know how I feel.
So don’t ask me again.

Among the daisies
sat the child,
looking so ever
meek and mild.
Mother sat down
by the child,
looked at her daughter
and sweetly smiled.
Picking the daisies
with the child,
from those gathered
a chain was stylized.
Around the neck
of the child,
she placed the chain
of daisies wild.
Touching the daisies
the deaf child,
looked at her mother
and sweetly smiled.

Mother! oh mother!
Where are your children?
Where have they been?
Where have they lost?
Mother! oh mother
Am on you
Yet can't see you
Is you don't like me
Or you don't like us
Mother! your children
Some on edges
Many at peaks
Why are all not equal
Are all not your children?
Maa I understand you
You have lost your children
You are been polluted all over
Maa my mother
Please batter your creation
Batter and make it new
This is a humble request
From one of your children.

I
Reg wished me to go with him to the field,
I paused because I did not want to go;
But in her quiet way she made me yield
Reluctantly, for she was breathing low.
Her hand she slowly lifted from her lap
And, smiling sadly in the old sweet way,
She pointed to the nail where hung my cap.
Her eyes said: I shall last another day.
But scarcely had we reached the distant place,
When o'er the hills we heard a faint bell ringing;
A boy came running up with frightened face;
We knew the fatal news that he was bringing.
I heard him listlessly, without a moan,
Although the only one I loved was gone.
II
The dawn departs, the morning is begun,
The trades come whispering from off the seas,
The fields of corn are golden in the sun,
The dark-brown tassels fluttering in the breeze;
The bell is sounding and the children pass,
Frog-leaping, skipping, shouting, laughing shrill,
Down the red road, over the pasture-grass,
Up to the school-house crumbling on the hill.
The older folk are at their peaceful toil,
Some pulling up the weeds, some plucking corn,
And others breaking up the sun-baked soil.
Float, faintly-scented breeze, at early morn
Over the earth where mortals sow and reap--
Beneath its breast my mother lies asleep.

(Note: — Pocahontas is buried at Gravesend, England.)
"Pocahontas' body, lovely as a poplar, sweet as a red haw in November or a pawpaw in May — did she wonder? does she remember — in the dust — in the cool tombs?"
CARL SANDBURG.
I
Powhatan was conqueror,
Powhatan was emperor.
He was akin to wolf and bee,
Brother of the hickory tree.
Son of the red lightning stroke
And the lightning-shivered oak.
His panther-grace bloomed in the maid
Who laughed among the winds and played
In excellence of savage pride,
Wooing the forest, open-eyed,
In the springtime,
In Virginia,
Our Mother, Pocahontas.
Her skin was rosy copper-red.
And high she held her beauteous head.
Her step was like a rustling leaf:
Her heart a nest, untouched of grief.
She dreamed of sons like Powhatan,
And through her blood the lightning ran.
Love-cries with the birds she sung,
Birdlike
In the grape-vine swung.
The Forest, arching low and wide
Gloried in its Indian bride.
Rolfe, that dim adventurer
Had not come a courtier.
John Rolfe is not our ancestor.
We rise from out the soul of her
Held in native wonderland,
While the sun's rays kissed her hand,
In the springtime,
In Virginia,
Our Mother, Pocahontas.
II
She heard the forest talking,
Across the sea came walking,
And traced the paths of Daniel Boone,
Then westward chased the painted moon.
She passed with wild young feet
On to Kansas wheat,
On to the miners' west,
The echoing cañons' guest,
Then the Pacific sand,
Waking,
Thrilling,
The midnight land....
On Adams street and Jefferson —
Flames coming up from the ground!
On Jackson street and Washington —
Flames coming up from the ground!
And why, until the dawning sun
Are flames coming up from the ground?
Because, through drowsy Springfield sped
This red-skin queen, with feathered head,
With winds and stars, that pay her court
And leaping beasts, that make her sport;
Because, gray Europe's rags august
She tramples in the dust;
Because we are her fields of corn;
Because our fires are all reborn
From her bosom's deathless embers,
Flaming
As she remembers
The springtime
And Virginia,
Our Mother, Pocahontas.
III
We here renounce our Saxon blood.
Tomorrow's hopes, an April flood
Come roaring in. The newest race
Is born of her resilient grace.
We here renounce our Teuton pride:
Our Norse and Slavic boasts have died:
Italian dreams are swept away,
And Celtic feuds are lost today....
She sings of lilacs, maples, wheat,
Her own soil sings beneath her feet,
Of springtime
And Virginia,
Our Mother, Pocahontas.

Cuddling in the arms her half-asphyxiated baby, howling,
she ran up the staircase of the apartment building that was set ablaze.
From the first floor to the second.
From the second to the third.
From the third to the fourth.
Until she had jumped onto the roof.
There, having choked with air, clinging to the chimney,
she looked down from where she could hear
the crackle of flames which were reaching higher and higher.
And then she became motionless and silent.
She kept silent to the end, till the moment
at which she suddenly clenched her eyelids,
stepped to the roof edge and, throwing forward her arms,
she dropped her baby down.
Two seconds earlier than she herself leapt down.

Sleep, sleep, my beloved,
without worry, without fear,
although my soul does not sleep,
although I do not rest.
Sleep, sleep, and in the night
may your whispers be softer
than a leaf of grass,
or the silken fleece of lambs.
May my flesh slumber in you,
my worry, my trembling.
In you, may my eyes close
and my heart sleep.

Most near, most dear, most loved and most far,
Under the window where I often found her
Sitting as huge as Asia, seismic with laughter,
Gin and chicken helpless in her Irish hand,
Irresistible as Rabelais, but most tender for
The lame dogs and hurt birds that surround her -
She is a procession no one can follow after
But be like a little dog following a brass band.
She will not glance up at the bomber, or condescend
To drop her gin and scuttle to a cellar,
But lean on the mahogany table like a mountain
Whom only faith can move, and so I send
O all my faith, and all my love to tell her
That she will move from mourning into morning.

Where the grass is tall and green,
I mash it flat.
I watch her as she watches me,
Unobserved because.
America,
Is such a brutal culture, a modern brutal culture.
Half the channels on basic cable are about murder,
Sex, primitive reality shows,
Cop's telling the viewer how dangerous their job's
Are,
To justify the violence that they inflict upon
Their victims.
You've seen the white cop's chase down the black dude
And stupidly ask dude, why he ran.
I keep waiting to hear dude say to the cop, because
You shoot unarmed blacks almost every day.
But dude doesn't, he just adds on to his woes by talking
To the cop and it for him gets worse.
American's,
Love the butcher's, if an American doesn't love the butcher
Then there's something wrong with that American.
Violence, murder and more murder and the kind of sex that
You would have,
If you could only get away with it, where you live.
The only thing American's love more than a butcher, is
To give them a trial and wait for the judges, to cave in to
The mob mentality.
The mob want's a brutal death drawn out.
The Judge's know that no normal individual would commit
Such a crime.
We know the butcher's do.
Violence and Death isn't about love but American's love it.
There's nothing intelligent about watching,
Murder more murder,
drugged then sexed, but then most American's aren't that
Intelligent, now are they?
In America the moon is violated, the bush is stripped of
All it's leaves,
Tree's small or large are consumed by some, not all but
American's,
Need to see, feel taste and touch and smell it all.
Just like you do,
Was mummy dear, was daddy large, did you watch your
Sister or your brother, kill them all!
And vampires do what vampires do and drain U.S. all.

With anticipation the drama
That unfolded
Turned and stared into
The devil’s eyes
I felt something or someone
Lurking in the shadows
One does not talk about
The truth or of him
Under the bed of his
Dead daughter
Now shame in fort of
His daughter
There will be NO trouble
The darkness had lent
Me slip away
Lighting of the torches
Danced off crosses of
Pins and needles
Need the cover of darkness
To hind your death
Placed my faith in to a old friend
Lived in harmony with
The good and the bad
Leaving a trail of tears
It too late
Wish I never been born
And burn for eternity

I MURDER hate by flood or field,
Tho' glory's name may screen us;
In wars at home I'll spend my blood—
Life-giving wars of Venus.
The deities that I adore
Are social Peace and Plenty;
I'm better pleas'd to make one more,
Than be the death of twenty.
I would not die like Socrates,
For all the fuss of Plato;
Nor would I with Leonidas,
Nor yet would I with Cato:
The zealots of the Church and State
Shall ne'er my mortal foes be;
But let me have bold Zimri's fate,
Within the arms of Cozbi!

The majority of Americans abhor conflict, especially war
Some carry placards and parade in protest
Some join militia groups
Most do nothing
Yet, everyone supports war
How?
By electing corrupt and hawkish politicians
By paying taxes that support military expansion
By accepting and believing corporate media propaganda
By buying and eating genetically modified and fast food
By sending our children to schools that are nothing more than public daycare
By allowing banks to plunder retirement savings and steal homes by foreclosure
By allowing Wall Street skullduggery, with no accountability or arrests
By allowing the invasion and occupation of Sovereign Nations
By being ambivalent and complacent to the destruction of a once great Nation
Yes we are all guilty of murder by association;
Murder of Planet Earth
Murder of each other
Murder of our children
Worst of all…Murder of our soul

Brought up in a prejudice dysfunctional household.
Took away the heart that once lived within your soul
Fiery eyes of a demon, a  prejudice beast
Live your heart, conjuring up a deploring feast
You’ve hurt, you’ve maimed, took education away.
Took bright eyes and turned them a shade of gray.
Many years took  its toile on the likes of you.
Bad heart, failed kidneys, time to pay your dues.
You reside in a room on the other side of town.
No one visits, no one cares, you sit wearing a frown.
Time to think and reflect while your body breaks down
No legacy to leave, you failed all around
The same people you despised, harbored hate for years
are the people who now console, dry your tears.
Why waste your time in this blessed life,
to create heartache, hate and contribute to ones strife.
Remember what you give out, you get back ten times more.
Father time will surely visit, come walking through your door.
Pick yourself up, start now before it’s too late.
Stop the cruelty, the pain, the destruction of hate.
(April 13/2007)

There was a wine
on the table,
There were people
on the bench.
There was a smile
on their faces,
There was a love
in the air.
There was a past
in her heart,
There was a future,
in his mind.
There were buses
in the streets,
There was her
with him again.
There was a bed,
in old attic.
There were them,
in the sheets.
There was a morning,
on the window.
There was a blood,
on his hands.

Blest pair of Sirens, pledges of Heav'n's joy,
Sphere-born harmonious Sisters, Voice and Verse,
Wed your divine sounds, and mixt power employ
Dead things with inbreath'd sense able to pierce,
And to our high-rais'd fantasy present
That undisturbed Song of pure concent,
Ay sung before that saphire-colour'd throne
To Him that sits thereon
With Saintly shout and solemn Jubilee,
Where the bright Seraphim in burning row
Their loud up-lifted Angel trumpets blow,
And the Cherubic host in thousand choirs
Touch their immortal Harps of golden wires,
With those just Spirits that wear victorious Palms,
Hymns devout and holy Psalms
Singing everlastingly;
That we on Earth with undiscording voice
May rightly answer that melodious noise;
As once we did, till disproportion'd sin
Jarr'd against Nature's chime, and with harsh din
Broke the fair music that all creatures made
To their great Lord, whose love their motion sway'd
In first obedience, and their state of good.
And keep in tune with Heav'n, till God ere long
To His celestial consort us unite,
To live with Him, and sing in endless morn of light.

I. Insomnia
The bulb at the front door burns and burns.
If it were a white rose it would tire of blooming
through another endless night.
The moon knows the routine;
it beats the bushes from east to west
and sets empty-handed. Again the one
she is waiting for has outrun the moon.
II. Old Money
The spotted hands shake as they polish the coins.
The shiny penny goes under the tongue,
the two silver pieces
weighted by pyramids
will shut down the eyes.
All the rest is paper,
useless in any world but this.
III. Home Movie
She knows that walk, that whistle, that knock.
It's the black wolf who sticks
his floured paw underneath the door.
She tries not to open. One look at his face
and she'll drop the gun. He will pick it up
and turn it on her where she waits,
her eyes shining, her hands over her head.
IV. Golden Boy
Whitewashed, the eyes refuse you.
And so the mouth must be serene,
the muscles play, the body
take an easy stance
to divert you from the two
boarded-up chambers
where someone has died.
V. Washing Day
Each year her laundry line gets lighter.
One by one they disappear,
ten little Indians. They take their socks,
their jeans, their stiff plaid shirts.
Above the Ford on its concrete blocks,
striped and zippered,
her cotton dress flutters on and on.

Glory of architect, glory of painter, and sculptor, and bard,
Living forever in temple and picture and statue and song, --
Look how the world with the lights that they lit is illumined and starred,
Brief was the flame of their life, but the lamps of their art burn long!
Where is the Master of Music, and how has he vanished away?
Where is the work that he wrought with his wonderful art in the air?
Gone, -- it is gone like the glow on the cloud at the close of the day!
The Master has finished his work, and the glory of music is -- where?
Once, at the wave of his wand, all the billows of musical sound
Followed his will, as the sea was ruled by the prophet of old:
Now that his hand is relaxed, and his rod has dropped to the ground,
Silent and dark are the shores where the marvellous harmonies rolled!
Nay, but not silent the hearts that were filled by that life-giving sea;
Deeper and purer forever the tides of their being will roll,
Grateful and joyful, O Master, because they have listened to thee, --
The glory of music endures in the depths of the human soul.

Listen to the music of love,
that seeps in from everywhere.
The rhythm of two hearts,
beating as one.
The murmurs of passion,
that consumes us all,
from time to time.
Listen to the music of love,
as it fills the air everywhere.

I have been urged by earnest violins
And drunk their mellow sorrows to the slake
Of all my sorrows and my thirsting sins.
My heart has beaten for a brave drum's sake.
Huge chords have wrought me mighty: I have hurled
Thuds of gods' thunder. And with old winds pondered
Over the curse of this chaotic world,-
With low lost winds that maundered as they wandered.
I have been gay with trivial fifes that laugh;
And songs more sweet than possible things are sweet;
And gongs, and oboes. Yet I guessed not half
Life's symphony till I had made hearts beat,
And touched Love's body into trembling cries,
And blown my love's lips into laughs and sighs.

Amber frosted reeds
in the summer's wind
swaying, dancing,
synchronised now
syncopated and back
shouting then singing
xanthine etudes
boisterous and raucous
bright and nimble
leaving pliant
graceful kisses
on a soft smooth cheek

There's not a joy the world can give like that it takes away
When the glow of early thought declines in feeling's dull decay;
'Tis not on youth's smooth cheek the blush alone, which fades so fast,
But the tender bloom of heart is gone, ere youth itself be past.
Then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness
Are driven o'er the shoals of guilt, or ocean of excess:
The magnet of their course is gone, or only points in vain
The shore to which their shivered sail shall never stretch again.
Then the mortal coldness of the soul like death itself comes down;
It cannot feel for others' woes, it dare not dream its own;
That heavy chill has frozen o'er the fountain of our tears,
And though the eye may sparkle still, 'tis where the ice appears.
Though wit may flash from fluent lips, and mirth distract the breast,
Through midnight hours that yield no more their former hope of rest,
'Tis but as ivy-leaves around the ruined turret wreath—
All green and wildly fresh without, but worn and grey beneath.
Oh, could I feel as I have felt, or be what I have been,
Or weep as I could once have wept, o'er many a vanished scene;
As springs in deserts found seem sweet, all brackish though they be,
So, midst the withered waste of life, those tears would flow to me.

Music, thou queen of heaven, care-charming spell,
That strik'st a stillness into hell;
Thou that tam'st tigers, and fierce storms, that rise,
With thy soul-melting lullabies;
Fall down, down, down, from those thy chiming spheres
To charm our souls, as thou enchant'st our ears.

Music is freedom that relentlessly exists
Freedom of speech
Freedom of thought
Freedom of creativity
Freedom of imagination
Music is ever soothingly healing
A bombardment of on-going expression of feelings
Music is a tool of unity
Always bringing people together as family
Hence be described as a mentor of spirituality
Music is magic
Performing its tricks
With sweet instrumental tones and lyrics
Music is emotionally captivating
Music is positively distracting
Music is a form of beautiful art
Passed on as a message on a public stage
Music is as powerful as water
Flowing in and out of generations
Trapped ever so often only by its own enormous power
Music is an angel
Singing out from the skies as she flies
Music is love
Music is the food of all moods
Music is perfect and it is good for you

Captured in the Psalms are the most eloquent Praises
And to read and ponder them affords one great graces.
The Lord's is the earth, and the sea, and the sky;
His is the moon, stars, sun and clouds rolling by.
His Seasons glorify Him each in their own way.
Think of the hope in the beauty of a Spring day,
Thunderclaps and lightning of Summer at play,
Fall's russets, browns, and yellows in breezes sway,
And Winter's cold, chill, and ice, with snows that lay.
Ponder the land with rocks, hills and mountains,
Rivers, streams, and geysers spewing like fountains.
Consider the lilies, roses, shrubs and trees
Which cause one to thank God on bended knees.
Think about the creatures on the land and in the sea
And Praise God for everyone that has come to be.
Praise the Lord morning, noon and night
Sing out His Praises with all of our might.
Keep a book of prayers within easy reach;
Devour everything it is meant to teach.
~ Let's remember ~
captured in the Psalms are the most eloquent Praises;
To read and ponder them affords one great graces,
For the Word of God throughout all ages
Is contained in our Bibles' well-worn pages.

Let us go gentle with the nature
It has given us many
Blessings to be proud of
Learn your Botany, Anatomy,
Geography, Astronomy, etc…
Before it is too late
Regardless of what the nature
Is giving us
A non-wise person will always
Fail to see the good side of it
He or She will only see curse
But let the rest of us go gentle with the nature…

Nature and God—I neither knew

They startled, like Executors
Of My identity.
Yet Neither told—that I could learn—
My Secret as secure

Or Mercury's affair—

human nature, mother nature,
enough of your torture.
safely nature, easy nature,
play your game,
foolish nature, custom nature,
I know your plan
can you nature, would you nature,
try to run away.
stupid nature, poor nature.
find my secret.
Miserable nature, faulty nature,
get out of my way.
It is in my nature,
It is my nature,
don't give me away.

Nature rarer uses yellow
Than another hue;
Saves she all of that for sunsets,--
Prodigal of blue,
Spending scarlet like a woman,
Yellow she affords
Only scantly and selectly,
Like a lover's words.

Mine are the night and morning,
The pits of air, the gulf of space,
The sportive sun, the gibbous moon,
The innumerable days.
I hid in the solar glory,
I am dumb in the pealing song,
I rest on the pitch of the torrent,
In slumber I am strong.
No numbers have counted my tallies,
No tribes my house can fill,
I sit by the shining Fount of Life,
And pour the deluge still;
And ever by delicate powers
Gathering along the centuries
From race on race the rarest flowers,
My wreath shall nothing miss.
And many a thousand summers
My apples ripened well,
And light from meliorating stars
With firmer glory fell.
I wrote the past in characters
Of rock and fire the scroll,
The building in the coral sea,
The planting of the coal.
And thefts from satellites and rings
And broken stars I drew,
And out of spent and aged things
I formed the world anew;
What time the gods kept carnival,
Tricked out in star and flower,
And in cramp elf and saurian forms
They swathed their too much power.
Time and Thought were my surveyors,
They laid their courses well,
They boiled the sea, and baked the layers
Or granite, marl, and shell.
But he, the man-child glorious,--
Where tarries he the while?
The rainbow shines his harbinger,
The sunset gleams his smile.
My boreal lights leap upward,
Forthright my planets roll,
And still the man-child is not born,
The summit of the whole.
Must time and tide forever run?
Will never my winds go sleep in the west?
Will never my wheels which whirl the sun
And satellites have rest?
Too much of donning and doffing,
Too slow the rainbow fades,
I weary of my robe of snow,
My leaves and my cascades;
I tire of globes and races,
Too long the game is played;
What without him is summer's pomp,
Or winter's frozen shade?
I travail in pain for him,
My creatures travail and wait;
His couriers come by squadrons,
He comes not to the gate.
Twice I have moulded an image,
And thrice outstretched my hand,
Made one of day, and one of night,
And one of the salt sea-sand.
One in a Judaean manger,
And one by Avon stream,
One over against the mouths of Nile,
And one in the Academe.
I moulded kings and saviours,
And bards o'er kings to rule;--
But fell the starry influence short,
The cup was never full.
Yet whirl the glowing wheels once more,
And mix the bowl again;
Seethe, fate! the ancient elements,
Heat, cold, wet, dry, and peace, and pain.
Let war and trade and creeds and song
Blend, ripen race on race,
The sunburnt world a man shall breed
Of all the zones, and countless days.
No ray is dimmed, no atom worn,
My oldest force is good as new,
And the fresh rose on yonder thorn
Gives back the bending heavens in dew.

I.
MAN, being the servant and interpreter of Nature, can do and understand so much and so much only as he has observed in fact or in thought of the course of nature: beyond this he neither knows anything nor can do anything.
II.
Neither the naked hand nor the understanding left to itself can effect much. It is by instruments and helps that the work is done, which are as much wanted for the understanding as for the hand. And as the instruments of the hand either give motion or guide it, so the instruments of the mind supply either suggestions for the understanding or cautions.
III.
Human knowledge and human power meet in one; for where the cause is not known the effect cannot be produced. Nature to be commanded must be obeyed; and that which in contemplation is as the cause is in operation as the rule.
IV.
Towards the effecting of works, all that man can do is to put together or put asunder natural bodies. The rest is done by nature working within.
V.
The study of nature with a view to works is engaged in by the mechanic, the mathematician, the physician, the alchemist, and the magician; but by all (as things now are) with slight endeavour and scanty success.
VI.
It would be an unsound fancy and self-contradictory to expect that things which have never yet been done can be done except by means which have never yet been tried.
VII.
The productions of the mind and hand seem very numerous in books and manufactures. But all this variety lies in an exquisite subtlety and derivations from a few things already known; not in the number of axioms.
VIII.
Moreover the works already known are due to chance and experiment rather than to sciences; for the sciences we now possess are merely systems for the nice ordering and setting forth of things already invented; not methods of invention or directions for new works.
IX.
The cause and root of nearly all evils in the sciences is this -- that while we falsely admire and extol the powers of the human mind we neglect to seek for its true helps.
X.
The subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of the senses and understanding; so that all those specious meditations, speculations, and glosses in which men indulge are quite from the purpose, only there is no one by to observe it.
XI.
As the sciences which we now have do not help us in finding out new works, so neither does the logic which we now have help us in finding out new sciences.
XII.
The logic now in use serves rather to fix and give stability to the errors which have their foundation in commonly received notions than to help the search after truth. So it does more harm than good.
XIII.
The syllogism is not applied to the first principles of sciences, and is applied in vain to intermediate axioms; being no match for the subtlety of nature. It commands assent therefore to the proposition, but does not take hold of the thing.
XIV.
The syllogism consists of propositions, propositions consist of words, words are symbols of notions. Therefore if the notions themselves (which is the root of the matter) are confused and over-hastily abstracted from the facts, there can be no firmness in the superstructure. Our only hope therefore lies in a true induction.
XV.
There is no soundness in our notions whether logical or physical. Substance, Quality, Action, Passion, Essence itself, are not sound notions: much less are Heavy, Light, Dense, Rare, Moist, Dry, Generation, Corruption, Attraction, Repulsion, Element, Matter, Form, and the like; but all are fantastical and ill defined.
XVI.
Our notions of less general species, as Man, Dog, Dove, and of the immediate perceptions of the sense, as Hot, Cold, Black, White, do not materially mislead us; yet even these are sometimes confused by the flux and alteration of matter and the mixing of one thing with another. All the others which men have hitherto adopted are but wanderings, not being abstracted and formed from things by proper methods.
XVII.
Nor is there less of wilfulness and wandering in the construction of axioms than in the formations of notions; not excepting even those very principles which are obtained by common induction; but much more in the axioms and lower propositions educed by the syllogism.
XVIII.
The discoveries which have hitherto been made in the sciences are such as lie close to vulgar notions, scarcely beneath the surface. In order to penetrate into the inner and further recesses of nature, it is necessary that both notions and axioms be derived from things by a more sure and guarded way; and that a method of intellectual operation be introduced altogether better and more certain.
XIX.
There are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from these principles, the truth of which it takes for settled and immovable, proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms. And this way is now in fashion. The other derives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all. This is the true way, but as yet untried.
XX.
The understanding left to itself takes the same course (namely, the former) which it takes in accordance with logical order. For the mind longs to spring up to positions of higher generality, that it may find rest there; and so after a little while wearies of experiment. But this evil is increased by logic, because of the order and solemnity of its disputations.
XXI.
The understanding left to itself, in a sober, patient, and grave mind, especially if it be not hindered by received doctrines, tries a little that other way, which is the right one, but with little progress; since the understanding, unless directed and assisted, is a thing unequal, and quite unfit to contend with the obscurity of things.
XXII.
Both ways set out from the senses and particulars, and rest in the highest generalities; but the difference between them is infinite. For the one just glances at experiment and particulars in passing, the other dwells duly and orderly among them. The one, again, begins at once by establishing certain abstract and useless generalities, the other rises by gradual steps to that which is prior and better known in the order of nature.
XXIII.
There is a great difference between the Idols of the human mind and the Ideas of the divine. That is to say, between certain empty dogmas, and the true signatures and marks set upon the works of creation as they are found in nature.
XXIV.
It cannot be that axioms established by argumentation should avail for the discovery of new works; since the subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of argument. But axioms duly and orderly formed from particulars easily discover the way to new particulars, and thus render sciences active.
XXV.
The axioms now in use, having been suggested by a scanty and manipular experience and a few particulars of most general occurrence, are made for the most part just large enough to fit and take these in: and therefore it is no wonder if they do not lead to new particulars. And if some opposite instance, not observed or not known before, chance to come in the way, the axiom is rescued and preserved by some frivolous distinction; whereas the truer course would be to correct the axiom itself.
XXVI.
The conclusions of human reason as ordinarily applied in matter of nature, I call for the sake of distinction Anticipations of Nature (as a thing rash or premature). That reason which is elicited from facts by a just and methodical process, I call Interpretation of Nature.
XXVII.
Anticipations are a ground sufficiently firm for consent; for even if men went mad all after the same fashion, they might agree one with another well enough.
XXVIII.
For the winning of assent, indeed, anticipations are far more powerful than interpretations; because being collected from a few instances, and those for the most part of familiar occurrence, they straightway touch the understanding and fill the imagination; whereas interpretations on the other hand, being gathered here and there from very various and widely dispersed facts, cannot suddenly strike the understanding; and therefore they must needs, in respect of the opinions of the time, seem harsh and out of tune; much as the mysteries of faith do.
XXIX.
In sciences founded on opinions and dogmas, the use of anticipations and logic is good; for in them the object is to command assent to the proposition, not to master the thing.
XXX.
Though all the wits of all the ages should meet together and combine and transmit their labours, yet will no great progress ever be made in science by means of anticipations; because radical errors in the first concoction of the mind are not to be cured by the excellence of functions and remedies subsequent.
XXXI.
It is idle to expect any great advancement in science from the superinducing and engrafting of new things upon old. We must begin anew from the very foundations, unless we would revolve for ever in a circle with mean and contemptible progress.
XXXII.
The honour of the ancient authors, and indeed of all, remains untouched; since the comparison I challenge is not of wits or faculties, but of ways and methods, and the part I take upon myself is not that of a judge, but of a guide.
XXXIII.
This must be plainly avowed: no judgment can be rightly formed either of my method or of the discoveries to which it leads, by means of anticipations (that is to say, of the reasoning which is now in use); since I cannot be called on to abide by the sentence of a tribunal which is itself on its trial.
XXXIV.
Even to deliver and explain what I bring forward is no easy matter; for things in themselves new will yet be apprehended with reference to what is old.
XXXV.
It was said by Borgia of the expedition of the French into Italy, that they came with chalk in their hands to mark out their lodgings, not with arms to force their way in. I in like manner would have my doctrine enter quietly into the minds that are fit and capable of receiving it; for confutations cannot be employed, when the difference is upon first principles and very notions and even upon forms of demonstration.
XXXVI.
One method of delivery alone remains to us; which is simply this: we must lead men to the particulars themselves, and their series and order; while men on their side must force themselves for awhile to lay their notions by and begin to familiarise themselves with facts.
XXXVII.
The doctrine of those who have denied that certainty could be attained at all, has some agreement with my way of proceeding at the first setting out; but they end in being infinitely separated and opposed. For the holders of that doctrine assert simply that nothing can be known; I also assert that not much can be known in nature by the way which is now in use. But then they go on to destroy the authority of the senses and understanding; whereas I proceed to devise and supply helps for the same.
XXXVIII.
The idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults.
XXXIX.
There are four classes of Idols which beset men's minds. To these for distinction's sake I have assigned names, -- calling the first class Idols of the Tribe; the second, Idols of the Cave; the third, Idols of the Market-place; the fourth, Idols of the Theatre.
XL.
The formation of ideas and axioms by true induction is no doubt the proper remedy to be applied for the keeping off and clearing away of idols. To point them out, however, is of great use; for the doctrine of Idols is to the Interpretation of Nature what the doctrine of the refutation of Sophisms is to common Logic.
XLI.
The Idols of the Tribe have their foundation in human nature itself, and in the tribe or race of men. For it is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things. On the contrary, all perceptions as well of the sense as of the mind are according to the measure of the individual and not according to the measure of the universe. And the human understanding is like a false mirror, which, receiving rays irregularly, distorts and discolours the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it.
XLII.
The Idols of the Cave are the idols of the individual man. For every one (besides the errors common to human nature in general) has a cave or den of his own, which refracts and discolours the light of nature; owing either to his own proper and peculiar nature; or to his education and conversation with others; or to the reading of books, and the authority of those whom he esteems and admires; or to the differences of impressions, accordingly as they take place in a mind preoccupied and predisposed or in a mind indifferent and settled; or the like. So that the spirit of man (according as it is meted out to different individuals) is in fact a thing variable and full of perturbation, and governed as it were by chance. Whence it was well observed by Heraclitus that men look for sciences in their own lesser worlds, and not in the greater or common world.
XLIII.
There are also Idols formed by the intercourse and association of men with each other, which I call Idols of the Market-place, on account of the commerce and consort of men there. For it is by discourse that men associate; and words are imposed according to the apprehension of the vulgar. And therefore the ill and unfit choice of words wonderfully obstructs the understanding. Nor do the definitions or explanations wherewith in some things learned men are wont to guard and defend themselves, by any means set the matter right. But words plainly force and overrule the understanding, and throw all into confusion, and lead men away into numberless empty controversies and idle fancies.
XLIV.
Lastly, there are Idols which have immigrated into men's minds from the various dogmas of philosophies, and also from wrong laws of demonstration. These I call Idols of the Theatre; because in my judgment all the received systems are but so many stage-plays, representing worlds of their own creation after an unreal and scenic fashion. Nor is it only of the systems now in vogue, or only of the ancient sects and philosophies, that I speak; for many more plays of the same kind may yet be composed and in like artificial manner set forth; seeing that errors the most widely different have nevertheless causes for the most part alike. Neither again do I mean this only of entire systems, but also of many principles and axioms in science, which by tradition, credulity, and negligence have come to be received.
But of these several kinds of Idols I must speak more largely and exactly, that the understanding may be duly cautioned.
XLV.
The human understanding is of its own nature prone to suppose the existence of more order and regularity in the world than it finds. And though there be many things in nature which are singular and unmatched, yet it devises for them parallels and conjugates and relatives which do not exist. Hence the fiction that all celestial bodies move in perfect circles; spirals and dragons being (except in name) utterly rejected. Hence too the element of Fire with its orb is brought in, to make up the square with the other three which the sense perceives. Hence also the ratio of density of the so-called elements is arbitrarily fixed at ten to one. And so on of other dreams. And these fancies affect not dogmas only, but simple notions also.
XLVI.
The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all things else to support and agree with it. And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side, yet these it either neglects and despises, or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects; in order that by this great and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusions may remain inviolate. And therefore it was a good answer that was made by one who when they showed him hanging in a temple a picture of those who had paid their vows as having escaped shipwreck, and would have him say whether he did not now acknowledge the power of the gods, -- "Aye," asked he again, "but where are they painted that were drowned after their vows?" And such is the way of all superstition, whether in astrology, dreams, omens, divine judgments, or the like; wherein men, having a delight in such vanities, mark the events where they are fulfilled, but where they fail, though this happen much oftener, neglect and pass them by. But with far more subtlety does this mischief insinuate itself into philosophy and the sciences; in which the first conclusion colours and brings into conformity with itself all that come after, though far sounder and better. Besides, independently of that delight and vanity which I have described, it is the peculiar and perpetual error of the human intellect to be more moved and excited by affirmatives than by negatives; whereas it ought properly to hold itself indifferently disposed towards both alike. Indeed in the establishment of any true axiom, the negative instance is the more forcible of the two.
XLVII.
The human understanding is moved by those things most which strike and enter the mind simultaneously and suddenly, and so fill the imagination; and then it feigns and supposes all other things to be somehow, though it cannot see how, similar to those few things by which it is surrounded. But for that going to and fro to remote and heterogeneous instances, by which axioms are tried as in the fire, the intellect is altogether slow and unfit, unless it be forced thereto by severe laws and overruling authority.
XLVIII.
The human understanding is unquiet; it cannot stop or rest, and still presses onward, but in vain. Therefore it is that we cannot conceive of any end or limit to the world; but always as of necessity it occurs to us that there is something beyond. Neither again can it be conceived how eternity has flowed down to the present day; for that distinction which is commonly received of infinity in time past and in time to come can by no means hold; for it would thence follow that one infinity is greater than another, and that infinity is wasting away and tending to become finite. The like subtlety arises touching the infinite divisibility of lines, from the same inability of thought to stop. But this inability interferes more mischievously in the discovery of causes: for although the most general principles in nature ought to be held merely positive, as they are discovered, and cannot with truth be referred to a cause; nevertheless the human understanding being unable to rest still seeks something prior in the order of nature. And then it is that in struggling towards that which is further off it falls back upon that which is more nigh at hand; namely, on final causes: which have relation clearly to the nature of man rather than to the nature of the universe; and from this source have strangely defiled philosophy. But he is no less an unskilled and shallow philosopher who seeks causes of that which is most general, than he who in things subordinate and subaltern omits to do so.
XLIX.
The human understanding is no dry light, but receives an infusion from the will and affections; whence proceed sciences which may be called "sciences as one would." For what a man had rather were true he more readily believes. Therefore he rejects difficult things from impatience of research; sober things, because they narrow hope; the deeper things of nature, from superstition; the light of experience, from arrogance and pride, lest his mind should seem to be occupied with things mean and transitory; things not commonly believed, out of deference to the opinion of the vulgar. Numberless in short are the ways, and sometimes imperceptible, in which the affections colour and infect the understanding.
L.
But by far the greatest hindrance and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness, incompetency, and deceptions of the senses; in that things which strike the sense outweigh things which do not immediately strike it, though they be more important. Hence it is that speculation commonly ceases where sight ceases; insomuch that of things invisible there is little or no observation. Hence all the working of the spirits inclosed in tangible bodies lies hid and unobserved of men. So also all the more subtle changes of form in the parts of coarser substances (which they commonly call alteration, though it is in truth local motion through exceedingly small spaces) is in like manner unobserved. And yet unless these two things just mentioned be searched out and brought to light, nothing great can be achieved in nature, as far as the production of works is concerned. So again the essential nature of our common air, and of all bodies less dense than air (which are very many), is almost unknown. For the sense by itself is a thing infirm and erring; neither can instruments for enlarging or sharpening the senses do much; but all the truer kind of interpretation of nature is effected by instances and experiments fit and apposite; wherein the sense decides touching the experiment only, and the experiment touching the point in nature and the thing itself.
LI.
The human understanding is of its own nature prone to abstractions and gives a substance and reality to things which are fleeting. But to resolve nature into abstractions is less to our purpose than to dissect her into parts; as did the school of Democritus, which went further into nature than the rest. Matter rather than forms should be the object of our attention, its configurations and changes of configuration, and simple action, and law of action or motion; for forms are figments of the human mind, unless you will call those laws of action forms.
LII.
Such then are the idols which I call Idols of the Tribe; and which take their rise either from the homogeneity of the substance of the human spirit, or from its preoccupation, or from its narrowness, or from its restless motion, or from an infusion of the affections, or from the incompetency of the senses, or from the mode of impression.
LIII.
The Idols of the Cave take their rise in the peculiar constitution, mental or bodily, of each individual; and also in education, habit, and accident. Of this kind there is a great number and variety; but I will instance those the pointing out of which contains the most important caution, and which have most effect in disturbing the clearness of the understanding.
LIV.
Men become attached to certain particular sciences and speculations, either because they fancy themselves the authors and inventors thereof, or because they have bestowed the greatest pains upon them and become most habituated to them. But men of this kind, if they betake themselves to philosophy and contemplations of a general character, distort and colour them in obedience to their former fancies; a thing especially to be noticed in Aristotle, who made his natural philosophy a mere bond-servant to his logic, thereby rendering it contentious and well nigh useless. The race of chemists again out of a few experiments of the furnace have built up a fantastic philosophy, framed with reference to a few things; and Gilbert also, after he had employed himself most laboriously in the study and observation of the loadstone, proceeded at once to construct an entire system in accordance with his favourite subject.
LV.
There is one principal and as it were radical distinction between different minds, in respect of philosophy and the sciences; which is this: that some minds are stronger and apter to mark the differences of things, others to mark their resemblances. The steady and acute mind can fix its contemplations and dwell and fasten on the subtlest distinctions: the lofty and discursive mind recognises and puts together the finest and most general resemblances. Both kinds however easily err in excess, by catching the one at gradations the other at shadows.
LVI.
There are found some minds given to an extreme admiration of antiquity, others to an extreme love and appetite for novelty: but few so duly tempered that they can hold the mean, neither carping at what has been well laid down by the ancients, nor despising what is well introduced by the moderns. This however turns to the great injury of the sciences and philosophy; since these affectations of antiquity and novelty are the humours of partisans rather than judgments; and truth is to be sought for not in the felicity of any age, which is an unstable thing, but in the light of nature and experience, which is eternal. These factions therefore must be abjured, and care must be taken that the intellect be not hurried by them into assent.
LVII.
Contemplations of nature and of bodies in their simple form break up and distract the understanding, while contemplations of nature and bodies in their composition and configuration overpower and dissolve the understanding: a distinction well seen in the school of Leucippus and Democritus as compared with the other philosophies. For that school is so busied with the particles that it hardly attends to the structure; while the others are so lost in admiration of the structure that they do not penetrate to the simplicity of nature. These kinds of contemplation should therefore be alternated and taken by turns; that so the understanding may be rendered at once penetrating and comprehensive, and the inconveniences above mentioned, with the idols which proceed from them, may be avoided.
LVIII.
Let such then be our provision and contemplative prudence for keeping off and dislodging the Idols of the Cave, which grow for the most part either out of the predominance of a favourite subject, or out of an excessive tendency to compare or to distinguish, or out of partiality for particular ages, or out of the largeness or minuteness of the objects contemplated. And generally let every student of nature take this as a rule, -- that whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion, and that so much the more care is to be taken in dealing with such questions to keep the understanding even and clear.
LIX.
But the Idols of the Market-place are the most troublesome of all: idols which have crept into the understanding through the alliances of words and names. For men believe that their reason governs words; but it is also true that words react on the understanding; and this it is that has rendered philosophy and the sciences sophistical and inactive. Now words, being commonly framed and applied according to the capacity of the vulgar, follow those lines of division which are most obvious to the vulgar understanding. And whenever an understanding of greater acuteness or a more diligent observation would alter those lines to suit the true divisions of nature, words stand in the way and resist the change. Whence it comes to pass that the high and formal discussions of learned men end oftentimes in disputes about words and names; with which (according to the use and wisdom of the mathematicians) it would be more prudent to begin, and so by means of definitions reduce them to order. Yet even definitions cannot cure this evil in dealing with natural and material things; since the definitions themselves consist of words, and those words beget others: so that it is necessary to recur to individual instances, and those in due series and order; as I shall say presently when I come to the method and scheme for the formation of notions and axioms.
LX.
The idols imposed by words on the understanding are of two kinds. They are either names of things which do not exist (for as there are things left unnamed through lack of observation, so likewise are there names which result from fantastic suppositions and to which nothing in reality corresponds), or they are names of things which exist, but yet confused and ill-defined, and hastily and irregularly derived from realities. Of the former kind are Fortune, the Prime Mover, Planetary Orbits, Element of Fire, and like fictions which owe their origin to false and idle theories. And this class of idols is more easily expelled, because to get rid of them it is only necessary that all theories should be steadily rejected and dismissed as obsolete.
But the other class, which springs out of a faulty and unskilful abstraction, is intricate and deeply rooted. Let us take for example such a word as humid; and see how far the several things which the word is used to signify agree with each other; and we shall find the word humid to be nothing else than a mark loosely and confusedly applied to denote a variety of actions which will not bear to be reduced to any constant meaning. For it both signifies that which easily spreads itself round any other body; and that which in itself is indeterminate and cannot solidise; and that which readily yields in every direction; and that which easily divides and scatters itself; and that which easily unites and collects itself; and that which readily flows and is put in motion; and that which readily clings to another body and wets it; and that which is easily reduced to a liquid, or being solid easily melts. Accordingly when you come to apply the word, -- if you take it in one sense, flame is humid; if in another, air is not humid; if in another, fine dust is humid; if in another, glass is humid. So that it is easy to see that the notion is taken by abstraction only from water and common and ordinary liquids, without any due verification.
There are however in words certain degrees of distortion and error. One of the least faulty kinds is that of names of substances, especially of lowest species and well-deduced (for the notion of chalk and of mud is good, of earth bad); a more faulty kind is that of actions, as to generate, to corrupt, to alter; the most faulty is of qualities (except such as are the immediate objects of the sense) as heavy, light, rare, dense, and the like. Yet in all these cases some notions are of necessity a little better than others, in proportion to the greater variety of subjects that fall within the range of the human sense.
LXI.
But the Idols of the Theatre are not innate, nor do they steal into the understanding secretly, but are plainly impressed and received into the mind from the play-books of philosophical systems and the perverted rules of demonstration. To attempt refutations in this case would be merely inconsistent with what I have already said: for since we agree neither upon principles nor upon demonstrations there is no place for argument. And this is so far well, inasmuch as it leaves the honour of the ancients untouched. For they are no wise disparaged the question between them and me being only as to the way. For as the saying is, the lame man who keeps the right road outstrips the runner who takes a wrong one. Nay it is obvious that when a man runs the wrong way, the more active and swift he is the further he will go astray.
But the course I propose for the discovery of sciences is such as leaves but little to the acuteness and strength of wits, but places all wits and understandings nearly on a level. For as in the drawing of a straight line or a perfect circle, much depends on the steadiness and practice of the hand, if it be done by aim of hand only, but if with the aid of rule or compass, little or nothing; so is it exactly with my plan. But though particular confutations would be of no avail, yet touching the sects and general divisions of such systems I must say something; something also touching the external signs which show that they are unsound; and finally something touching the causes of such great infelicity and of such lasting and general agreement in error; that so the access to truth may be made less difficult, and the human understanding may the more willingly submit to its purgation and dismiss its idols.
LXII.
Idols of the Theatre, or of Systems, are many, and there can be and perhaps will be yet many more. For were it not that new for many ages men's minds have been busied with religion and theology; and were it not that civil governments, especially monarchies, have been averse to such novelties, even in matters speculative; so that men labour therein to the peril and harming of their fortunes, -- not only unrewarded, but exposed also to contempt and envy; doubtless there would have arisen many other philosophical sects like to those which in great variety flourished once among the Greeks. For as on the phenomena of the heavens many hypotheses may be constructed, so likewise (and more also) many various dogmas may be set up and established on the phenomena of philosophy. And in the plays of this philosophical theatre you may observe the same thing which is found in the theatre of the poets, that stories invented for the stage are more compact and elegant, and more as one would wish them to be, than true stories out of history.
In general however there is taken for the material of philosophy either a great deal out of a few things, or a very little out of many things; so that on both sides philosophy is based on too narrow a foundation of experiment and natural history, and decides on the authority of too few cases. For the Rational School of philosophers snatches from experience a variety of common instances, neither duly ascertained nor diligently examined and weighed, and leaves all the rest to meditation and agitation of wit.
There is also another class of philosophers, who having bestowed much diligent and careful labour on a few experiments, have thence made bold to educe and construct systems; wresting all other facts in a strange fashion to conformity therewith.
And there is yet a third class, consisting of those who out of faith and veneration mix their philosophy with theology and traditions; among whom the vanity of some has gone so far aside as to seek the origin of sciences among spirits and genii. So that this parent stock of errors -- this false philosophy -- is of three kinds; the Sophistical, the Empirical, and the Superstitious.
LXIII.
The most conspicuous example of the first class was Aristotle, who corrupted natural philosophy by his logic: fashioning the world out of categories; assigning to the human soul, the noblest of substances, a genus from words of the second intention; doing the business of density and rarity (which is to make bodies of greater or less dimensions, that is, occupy greater or less spaces), by the frigid distinction of act and power; asserting that single bodies have each a single and proper motion, and that if they participate in any other, then this results from an external cause; and imposing countless other arbitrary restrictions on the nature of things; being always more solicitous to provide an answer to the question and affirm something positive in words, than about the inner truth of things; a failing best shown when his philosophy is compared with other systems of note among the Greeks. For the Homoeomera of Anaxagoras; the Atoms of Leucippus and Democritus; the Heaven and Earth of Parmenides; the Strife and Friendship of Empedocles; Heraclitus's doctrine how bodies are resolved into the indifferent nature of fire, and remoulded into solids; have all of them some taste of the natural philosopher, -- some savour of the nature of things, and experience, and bodies; whereas in the physics of Aristotle you hear hardly anything but the words of logic; which in his metaphysics also, under a more imposing name, and more forsooth as a realist than a nominalist, he has handled over again. Nor let any weight be given to the fact, that in his books on animals and his problems, and other of his treatises, there is frequent dealing with experiments. For he had come to his conclusion before; he did not consult experience, as he should have done, in order to the framing of his decisions and axioms; but having first determined the question according to his will, he then resorts to experience, and bending her into conformity with his placets leads her about like a captive in a procession; so that even on this count he is more guilty than his modern followers, the schoolmen, who have abandoned experience altogether.
LXIV.
But the Empirical school of philosophy gives birth to dogmas more deformed and monstrous than the Sophistical or Rational school. For it has its foundations not in the light of common notions, (which though it be a faint and superficial light, is yet in a manner universal, and has reference to many things,) but in the narrowness and darkness of a few experiments. To those therefore who are daily busied with these experiments, and have infected their imagination with them, such a philosophy seems probable and all but certain; to all men else incredible and vain. Of this there is a notable instance in the alchemists and their dogmas; though it is hardly to be found elsewhere in these times, except perhaps in the philosophy of Gilbert. Nevertheless with regard to philosophies of this kind there is one caution not to be omitted; for I foresee that if ever men are roused by my admonitions to betake themselves seriously to experiment and bid farewell to sophistical doctrines, then indeed through the premature hurry of the understanding to leap or fly to universals and principles of things, great danger may be apprehended from philosophies of this kind; against which evil we ought even now to prepare.
LXV.
But the corruption of philosophy by superstition and an admixture of theology is far more widely spread, and does the greatest harm, whether to entire systems or to their parts. For the human understanding is obnoxious to the influence of the imagination no less than to the influence of common notions. For the contentious and sophistical kind of philosophy ensnares the understanding; but this kind, being fanciful and timid and half poetical, misleads it more by flattery. For there is in man an ambition of the understanding, no less than of the will, especially in high and lofty spirits.
Of this kind we have among the Greeks a striking example in Pythagoras, though he united with it a coarser and more cumbrous superstition; another in Plato and his school, more dangerous and subtle. It shows itself likewise in parts of other philosophies, in the introduction of abstract forms and final causes and first causes, with the omission in most cases of causes intermediate, and the like. Upon this point the greatest caution should be used. For nothing is so mischievous as the apotheosis of error; and it is a very plague of the understanding for vanity to become the object of veneration. Yet in this vanity some of the moderns have with extreme levity indulged so far as to attempt to found a system of natural philosophy on the first chapter of Genesis, on the book of Job, and other parts of the sacred writings; seeking for the dead among the living: which also makes the inhibition and repression of it the more important, because from this unwholesome mixture of things human and divine there arises not only a fantastic philosophy but also an heretical religion. Very meet it is therefore that we be sober-minded, and give to faith that only which is faith's.
LXVI.
So much then for the mischievous authorities of systems, which are founded either on common notions, or on a few experiments, or on superstition. It remains to speak of the faulty subject-matter of contemplations, especially in natural philosophy. Now the human understanding is infected by the sight of what takes place in the mechanical arts, in which the alteration of bodies proceeds chiefly by composition or separation, and so imagines that something similar goes on in the universal nature of things. From this source has flowed the fiction of elements, and of their concourse for the formation of natural bodies. Again, when man contemplates nature working freely, he meets with different species of things, of animals, of plants, of minerals; whence he readily passes into the opinion that there are in nature certain primary forms which nature intends to educe, and that the remaining variety proceeds from hindrances and aberrations of nature in the fulfilment of her work, or from the collision of different species and the transplanting of one into another. To the first of these speculations we owe our primary qualities of the elements; to the other our occult properties and specific virtues; and both of them belong to those empty compendia of thought wherein the mind rests, and whereby it is diverted from more solid pursuits. It is to better purpose that the physicians bestow their labour on the secondary qualities of matter, and the operations of attraction, repulsion, attenuation, conspissation, dilatation, astriction, dissipation, maturation, and the like; and were it not that by those two compendia which I have mentioned (elementary qualities, to wit, and specific virtues) they corrupted their correct observations in these other matters, -- either reducing them to first qualities and their subtle and incommensurable mixtures, or not following them out with greater and more diligent observation to third and fourth qualities, but breaking off the scrutiny prematurely, -- they had made much greater progress. Nor are powers of this kind (I do not say the same, but similar) to be sought for only in the medicines of the human body, but also in the changes of all other bodies.
But it is a far greater evil that they make the quiescent principles, wherefrom, and not the moving principles, whereby, things are produced, the object of their contemplation and inquiry. For the former tend to discourse, the latter to works. Nor is there any value in those vulgar distinctions of motion which are observed in the received system of natural philosophy, as generation, corruption, augmentation, diminution, alteration, and local motion. What they mean no doubt is this: -- if a body, in other respects not changed, be moved from its place, this is local motion; if without change of place or essence, it be changed in quality, this is alteration; if by reason of the change the mass and quantity of the body do not remain the same, this is augmentation or diminution; if they be changed to such a degree that they change their very essence and substance and turn to something else, this is generation and corruption. But all this is merely popular, and does not at all go deep into nature; for these are only measures and limits, not kinds of motion. What they intimate is how far, not by what means, or from what source. For they do not suggest anything with regard either to the desires of bodies or to the development of their parts: it is only when that motion presents the thing grossly and palpably to the sense as different from what it was, that they begin to mark the division. Even when they wish to suggest something with regard to the causes of motion, and to establish a division with reference to them, they introduce with the greatest negligence a distinction between motion natural and violent; a distinction which is itself drawn entirely from a vulgar notion, since all violent motion is also in fact natural; the external efficient simply setting nature working otherwise than it was before. But if, leaving all this, any one shall observe (for instance) that there is in bodies a desire of mutual contact, so as not to suffer the unity of nature to be quite separated or broken and a vacuum thus made; or if any one say that there is in bodies a desire of resuming their natural dimensions or tension, so that if compressed within or extended beyond them, they immediately strive to recover themselves, and fall back to their old volume and extent; or if any one say that there is in bodies a desire of congregating towards masses of kindred nature, -- of dense bodies, for instance, towards the globe of the earth, of thin and rare bodies towards the compass of the sky; all these and the like are truly physical kinds of motion; -- but those others are entirely logical and scholastic, as is abundantly manifest from this comparison.
Nor again is it a less evil, that in their philosophies and contemplations their labour is spent in investigating and handling the first principles of things and the highest generalities of nature; whereas utility and the means of working result entirely from things intermediate. Hence it is that men cease not from abstracting nature till they come to potential and uninformed matter, nor on the other hand from dissecting nature till they reach the atom; things which, even if true, can do but little for the welfare of mankind.
LXVII.
A caution must also be given to the understanding against the intemperance which systems of philosophy manifest in giving or withholding assent; because intemperance of this kind seems to establish Idols and in some sort to perpetuate them, leaving no way open to reach and dislodge them.
This excess is of two kinds: the first being manifest in those who are ready in deciding, and render sciences dogmatic and magisterial; the other in those who deny that we can know anything, and so introduce a wandering kind of inquiry that leads to nothing; of which kinds the former subdues, the latter weakens the understanding. For the philosophy of Aristotle, after having by hostile confutations destroyed all the rest (as the Ottomans serve their brothers), has laid down the law on all points; which done, he proceeds himself to raise new questions of his own suggestion, and dispose of them likewise; so that nothing may remain that is not certain and decided: a practice which holds and is in use among his successors.
The school of Plato, on the other hand, introduced Acatalepsia, at first in jest and irony, and in disdain of the older sophists, Protagoras, Hippias, and the rest, who were of nothing else so much ashamed as of seeming to doubt about anything. But the New Academy made a dogma of it, and held it as a tenet. And though their's is a fairer seeming way than arbitrary decisions; since they say that they by no means destroy all investigation, like Pyrrho and his Refrainers, but allow of some things to be followed as probable, though of none to be maintained as true; yet still when the human mind has once despaired of finding truth, its interest in all things grows fainter; and the result is that men turn aside to pleasant disputations and discourses and roam as it were from object to object, rather than keep on a course of severe inquisition. But, as I said at the beginning and am ever urging, the human senses and understanding, weak as they are, are not to be deprived of their authority, but to be supplied with helps.
LXVIII.
So much concerning the several classes of Idols, and their equipage: all of which must be renounced and put away with a fixed and solemn determination, and the understanding thoroughly freed and cleansed; the entrance into the kingdom of man, founded on the sciences, being not much other than the entrance into the kingdom of heaven, whereinto none may enter except as a little child.

When the early morning is born with heavenly blessed
When the bright sun rays shower through the misty clouds
When the birds choir being to chirp their songs on the trees
then the day being with a wonderful of nature.
I can feel the Mother Nature touches me with her love
I can feel the nature illuminates my heart and brighten my soul
I can see the green grass in summer-spread lovely
I can see the flowers in the spring bloomed lavishly
I can see the leaves falls in the autumn covered earth greatly
I can see the trees full of snow in the winter sprinkled
I can see the stream water gurgles from the mountain
I can see the fauna in the jungles freely set to live happily
I can see the barren lands wet and fertile
Not only they are beautiful in nature
but they serve a purpose for us
Not only they are beauty as forest
but they serve food and water for us
Always, praise the God and thank HIM for HIS beautiful creation
What a wonderful world of nature that you and me live.

------The sky is overcast
With a continuous cloud of texture close,
Heavy and wan, all whitened by the Moon,
Which through that veil is indistinctly seen,
A dull, contracted circle, yielding light
So feebly spread, that not a shadow falls,
Chequering the ground--from rock, plant, tree, or tower.
At length a pleasant instantaneous gleam
Startles the pensive traveller while he treads
His lonesome path, with unobserving eye
Bent earthwards; he looks up--the clouds are split
Asunder,--and above his head he sees
The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens.
There, in a black-blue vault she sails along,
Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small
And sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss
Drive as she drives: how fast they wheel away,
Yet vanish not!--the wind is in the tree,
But they are silent;--still they roll along
Immeasurably distant; and the vault,
Built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds,
Still deepens its unfathomable depth.
At length the Vision closes; and the mind,
Not undisturbed by the delight it feels,
Which slowly settles into peaceful calm,
Is left to muse upon the solemn scene.

At night, when the sea cradles me
And the pale star gleam
Lies down on its broad waves,
Then I free myself wholly
From all activity and all the love
And stand silent and breathe purely,
Alone, alone cradled by the sea
That lies there, cold and silent, with a thousand lights.
Then I have to think of my friends
And my gaze sinks into their gazes
And I ask each one, silent, alone:
"Are you still mine"
Is my sorrow a sorrow to you, my death a death?
Do you feel from my love, my grief,
Just a breath, just an echo?"
And the sea peacefully gazes back, silent,
And smiles: no.
And no greeting and now answer comes from anywhere.

The cold slope is standing in darkness
But the south of the trees is dry to the touch
The heavy limbs climb into the moonlight bearing feathers
I came to watch these
White plants older at night
The oldest
Come first to the ruins
And I hear magpies kept awake by the moon
The water flows through its
Own fingers without end
Tonight once more
I find a single prayer and it is not for men

I heard the trailing garments of the Night
Sweep through her marble halls!
I saw her sable skirts all fringed with light
From the celestial walls!
I felt her presence, by its spell of might,
Stoop o'er me from above;
The calm, majestic presence of the Night,
As of the one I love.
I heard the sounds of sorrow and delight,
The manifold, soft chimes,
That fill the haunted chambers of the Night
Like some old poet's rhymes.
From the cool cisterns of the midnight air
My spirit drank repose;
The fountain of perpetual peace flows there,--
From those deep cisterns flows.
O holy Night! from thee I learn to bear
What man has borne before!
Thou layest thy finger on the lips of Care,
And they complain no more.
Peace!  Peace!  Orestes-like I breathe this prayer!
Descend with broad-winged flight,
The welcome, the thrice-prayed for, the most fair,
The best-beloved Night!

That long black hearse done sped,
The street light
At his corner
Shined just like a tear--
That boy that they was mournin'
Was so dear, so dear
To them folks that brought the flowers,
To that girl who paid the preacher man--
It was all their tears that made
That poor boy's
Funeral grand.

after Juan Ramon
A child wakens in a cold apartment.
The windows are frosted. Outside he hears
words rising from the streets, words he cannot
understand, and then the semis gear down
for the traffic light on Houston. He sleeps
again and dreams of another city
on a high hill above a wide river
bathed in sunlight, and the dream is his life
as he will live it twenty years from now.
No, no, you say, dreams do not work that way,
they function otherwise. Perhaps in the world
you're right, but on Houston tonight two men
are trying to change a tire as snow gathers
on their shoulders and scalds their ungloved hands.
The older one, the father, is close to tears,
for he's sure his son, who's drunk, is laughing
secretly at him for all his failures
as a man and a father, and he is
laughing to himself but because he's happy
to be alone with his father as he was
years ago in another life where snow
never fell. At last he slips the tire iron
gently from his father's grip and kneels
down in the unstained snow and unbolts the wheel
while he sings of drinking a glass of wine,
the black common wine of Alicante,
in raw sunlight. Now the father joins in,
and the words rise between the falling flakes
only to be transformed into the music
spreading slowly over the oiled surface
of the river that runs through every child's dreams.

Silent, silent night,
Quench the holy light
Of thy torches bright;
For possessed of Day
Thousand spirits stray
That sweet joys betray.
Why should joys be sweet
Used with deceit,
Nor with sorrows meet?
But an honest joy
Does itself destroy
For a harlot coy.

I wake up cold, I who
Prospered through dreams of heat
Wake to their residue,
Sweat, and a clinging sheet.
My flesh was its own shield:
Where it was gashed, it healed.
I grew as I explored
The body I could trust
Even while I adored
The risk that made robust,
A world of wonders in
Each challenge to the skin.
I cannot but be sorry
The given shield was cracked,
My mind reduced to hurry,
My flesh reduced and wrecked.
I have to change the bed,
But catch myself instead
Stopped upright where I am
Hugging my body to me
As if to shield it from
The pains that will go through me,
As if hands were enough
To hold an avalanche off.

In this evil year, autumn comes early...
I walk by night in the field, alone, the rain clatters,
The wind on my hat...And you? And you, my friend?
You are standing- maybe- and seeing the sickle moon
Move in a small arc over the forests
And bivouac fire, red in the black valley.
You are lying- maybe- in a straw field and sleeping
And dew falls cold on your forehead and battle jacket.
It's possible tonight you're on horseback,
The farthest outpost, peering along, with a gun in your fist,
Smiling, whispering, to your exhausted horse.
Maybe- I keep imagining- you are spending the night
As a guest in a strange castle with a park
And writing a letter by candlelight, and tapping
On the piano keys by the window,
Groping for a sound...
- And maybe
You are already silent, already dead, and the day
Will shine no longer into your beloved
Serious eyes, and your beloved brown hand hangs wilted,
And your white forehead split open- Oh, if only,
If only, just once, that last day, I had shown you, told you
Something of my love, that was too timid to speak!
But you know me, you know...and, smiling, you nod
Tonight in front of your strange castle,
And you nod to your horse in the drenched forest,
And you nod to your sleep to your harsh clutter of straw,
And think about me, and smile.
And maybe,
Maybe some day you will come back from the war,
and take a walk with me some evening,
And somebody will talk about Longwy, Luttich, Dammerkirch,
And smile gravely, and everything will be as before,
And no one will speak a word of his worry,
Of his worry and tenderness by night in the field,
Of his love. And with a single joke
You will frighten away the worry, the war, the uneasy nights,
The summer lightning of shy human friendship,
Into the cool past that will never come back.

Have you ever sailed on vast ocean,
With no island to see, and things are out of reach?
With dreams and mysteries filled this ocean,
And a never ending faith that someone would teach?
Have you ever felt that feeling,
Of a deep calmness within you that's hard to fight?
And no one could help you believing,
That you're striving for the right?
Did you ever sailed on an ocean,
That further placed upon your heart?
For deeply below this ocean,
Lies a silent whisper, where love starts.
An ocean of Love, the ocean of dreams
Where you can find solace and exceptional truth
Though pain resides even if you don't dream
As the existence of love bears its fruit.
The fruit of harmony, bliss, and wonder
Without the seed that's buried down below
Like a pearl that lies down under
The ocean of love they call, starts hello.
Upon this vast ocean, two souls were me and you
Over the waves and across the surface
I have found a love so true
The ocean of love was then the wondrous place.

How vast is the ocean?
I know it is in wide scope
How dangerous this ocean?
A lot and too much chances
To explore, you can be drowned
With the waves you can be nowhere
How deep it could be?
Like the love of yours
How vast, how deep
How blue, how loyal
Deeper, bluer than blue
So I dunk my desolate life into that ocean
Immerse it into utmost contentment
Just to feel that lost pleasing touch
To get the fullness of the bright life
I found it, its deeper in you
Bluer than blue ocean
I enjoy the scenery of bright life

Giving or not giving voice to the heretical words...
Understanding that the true love is a scarification.....
For being or not being....
True love inundating the conundrum
Like that sacred river of longing,
Sometimes flowing swiftly through landscapes
Astounding the lurid heart.....
The sound of silence passing...
Passions galvanizing the wounds and pain mares for enduring...
Trying to heal the injury...
Flying gulls beneath the lower bowl, touching the blue waters of the ocean.....
Waves and sad memories  dancing on the golden sand....
Shying away from the  horizon line....
Vessels  screaming and shouting their hearts out....
Swimming across the ocean of red burning coals,
Searching for that  golden threshold.....
The color spectrum giving the  necessary senses to the lights of absolution,
When their senses turn inward.....
Gazing the mountain from the window pane...
From the indoor side of that rain-rinsed windowpane.....
Sitting on that mountain and gazing at the stars....
Birds gliding across, like rainbow rising, spreading their wings, streaming..
Those birds flying in a variety of ways, ranging from gliding to soaring to flapping....
The crystalline steeping slopes of the mountain multi-faces....
Being decorated with climbing ropes, heavenly as seen from above....
And the crystalline waters, steeping cliffs, hidden lakes  and lush forests...
A sign of a divine love...
Understanding that love is like the Earth and the gravity,
Inseparable.....
Groans and moans leading to  mortuaries....
Life is like walking in the middle of the park,
Embracing the crouch air,
Or embracing change by resisting the defensive crouch.....
And going deep into the human system, feeling like being born again....
The smile on the face painting an episode of the past,
Engraving our hearts with golden debris,
Like a golden pyramid, contracting pyramid.....
Generating our consciousness  and chasing away insanity....
Sounds of silence passing...
Being like a  blue ocean...

Like the Ocean kissed The Sky
At the most beautiful place under the sun,
For true love is so hard to find
but we just keep searching
for our soul can be complete
It's in that lovely special place
of bluest of blues which are both under
the sun that gives you so much beauty
It's where the ocean and sky
never ends kissed by the sun over and
over a again.
Our hearts come together to
kiss like the ocean kissed the sky
for our hearts are like two large waves
falling on one another over and over
again.
As i swim and you fly
we will meet at
where the ocean kissed the sky

While sailing across the wide Indian Ocean,
My stomach queasy, from the rolling motion.
I took a stroll along the upper deck,
A scarf tied loosely around my neck
Looking out over the ever moving sea,
A strange emotion came over me.
What was I doing on this old boat?
It was a wonder that she was still afloat.
I leaned against an old wooden plank,
When all of a sudden my mind went blank.
I found myself floating three feet above my head,
What is this I asked myself am I now dead?
I rose high up into the cloudless sky,
Up and up it was ever so high.
Looking down I could see the small ship upon the sea,
I got frightened and returned promptly to me.
We sailed on to the Port of old Bombay,
Where I caught home an aeroplane I am happy to say.
I will no more sail upon an ocean,
For it fills my heart with strange emotion.

The hot noon sun rises up,
And the dry leaves of the season drop,
Cigarette smoke and the smell of tobacco rise,
And the loud honk of the car cries.
Life is dull in the city streets,
But the freshness lies where the ocean and land meet,
Deep deep inside, A hundred miles down,
Where no god or man wear a precious crown.
The ocean has its own melody as most think its cruel,
But if thy know it well, Thy will then know it wear the most precious jewel,
Poseidon himself bows down to the goddess,
As he knows the beauty and the ever lasting brightness.
Oh my Mistress I bow down to thee,
Your brightness, Light or beauty all shall see,
Through the eyes of my words, They shall now believe,
The beauty of something they negatively perceived.

Life is like vast ocean,
Full of sorrow and pain,
Joy less and worry main,
Not to loose hope and energy regain,
To Learn a lesson from each failure,
Content with less and nothing to procure,
Difficulties more but patience to endure,
No immediate result but success is sure,
If life was ever to be smooth,
Who would pray and take oath?
Eat more and carry the weight
Sound sleep and get up late
Life and death are two parts of wheel
failure of any one may makes us to feel
Life may move on and doesn’t come to an end
Pray for success and ways to mend
who understands life but never lament?
No regrets but passing the comment
trying very hard to overcome the shock
Time never stops as clicks the time in clock
Hardship may give you endurance and strength
Will power to withstand and go to any length
No loss of face but to feel at ease,
Success to knock and failure to cease

... Oceanward I am ever yearning,
Where far it rolls in its calm and grandeur,
The weight of mountain-like fogbanks bearing,
Forever wandering and returning.
The skies may lower, the land may call it,
It knows no resting and knows no yielding.
In nights of summer, in storms of winter,
Its surges murmur the self-same longing.
Yes, oceanward I am ever yearning,
Where far is lifted its broad, cold forehead!
Thereon the world throws its deepest shadow
And mirrors whispering all its anguish.
Though warm and blithesome the bright sun stroke it
With joyous message, that life is gladness,
Yet ice-cold, changelessly melancholy,
It drowns the sorrow and drowns the solace.
The full moon pulling, the tempest lifting,
Must loose their hold on the flowing water.
Down whirling lowlands and crumbling mountains
It to eternity tireless washes.
What forth it draws must the one way wander.
What once is sunken arises never.
No message comes thence, no cry is heard thence;
Its voice, its silence, can none interpret.
Yes, toward the ocean, far out toward ocean,
That knows no hour of self-atonement!
For all that suffer release it offers,
But trails forever its own enigma.
A strange alliance with Death unites it,
That all it give Him,--itself excepting!
I feel, vast Ocean, thy solemn sadness,
To thee abandon my weak devices,
To thee let fly all my anxious longings:
May thy cool breath to my heart bring healing!
Let Death now follow, his booty seeking:
The moves are many before the checkmate!
Awhile I'll harass thy love of plunder,
As on I scud 'neath thy angry eyebrows;
Thou only fillest my swelling mainsail,
Though Death ride fast on thy howling tempest;
Thy billows raging shall bear the faster
My little vessel to quiet waters.
Ah! Thus alone at the helm in darkness,
By all forsaken, by Death forgotten,
When sails unknown far away are wafted
And some swift-coursing by night are passing,
To note the ground-swell's resistless current,
The sighing heart of the breathing ocean --
Or small waves plashing along the planking,
Its quiet pastime amid its sadness.
Then glide my lingering longings over
Into the ocean-deep grief of nature,
The night's, the water's united coldness
Prepares my spirit for death's dark dwelling.
Then comes day's dawning! My soul bounds upward
On beams of light to the vault of heaven;
My ship-steed sniffing its flank is laving
With buoyant zest in the cooling billow.
With song the sailor to masthead clambers
To clear the sail that shall swell more freely,
And thoughts are flying like birds aweary
Round mast and yard-arm, but find no refuge.  ...
Yes, toward the ocean! To follow Vikar!
To sail like him and to sink as he did,
For great King Olaf the prow defending!
With keel unswerving the cold thought cleaving,
But hope deriving from lightest breezes!
Death's eager fingers so near the rudder,
While heaven's clearness the way illumines!
And then at last in the final hour
To feel the bolts and the nails are yielding
And Death is pressing the seams asunder,
That in may stream the absolving water!
Wet winding-sheets shall be folded round me,
And I descend to eternal silence,
While rolling billows my name bear shoreward
In spacious nights 'neath the cloudless moonlight!

Waves of life lap an eternal beach
each one taking on its form
from moon and stars and sun
each wave a single wave of life
born of the one same ocean
and infinitesimally shaping the coastline
of an unseen continent
as they rise and fall
on an endless beach.
Waves of life playing as they dance
and meet and merge
and running, race for the shore
where it seems they are no more.
But their mark remains
on that eternal distant land
unseen by mortal eyes
the waves that carry the human race
to a far off distant place
that never leaves or departs
from the still innermost point
in each and every heart.
Watch the years play out their course
as on the last day of natures year
it endeth here with celebrations
never just for the past
but looking towards the path
to reach that distant shore at last.

Sneaking through the back alleys
Their evil intentions muted
Uzis ready in their hands
Their minds full of hate
Sons of terror struck
Swollen with innocent blood
Walls were dripping with fresh paint
A new portrait of terror appeared
Paraded in the streets of Paris
By the fanatical servants of terror
The peaceful night ripped apart
By the flood of innocent blood
That painted the streets red
In a midnight exhibition of terror
The bleeding Graffiti in Paris

My mother was much sensitive to cleanliness,
She was fond of perfumes and fragrant flowers,
She was famous for her kindness,
And hard works, in the suns and showers
She loved all children, particularly her own,
She was fond of sweets and ice-creams,
She was married at an age, not much grown,
She remained a girl with teen aged dreams.
She liked melodies and fine arts,
She was fond of fictions and movies in the hall,
Knitting, stitching and cooking, her crafts.
My father a contrast to her at all.
After working whole day, since early morning,
Restless lady took some rest mid day,
A shower and change of dress, in the evening,
The small blue bottle of perfume, for the tired clay!
(I still feel fragrance of “Evening in Paris”, a perfume in a small blue bottle)

Don't talk to me of love. I've had an earful
And I get tearful when I've downed a drink or two.
I'm one of your talking wounded.
I'm a hostage. I'm maroonded.
But I'm in Paris with you.
Yes I'm angry at the way I've been bamboozled
And resentful at the mess I've been through.
I admit I'm on the rebound
And I don't care where are we bound.
I'm in Paris with you.
Do you mind if we do not go to the Louvre
If we say sod off to sodding Notre Dame,
If we skip the Champs Elysées
And remain here in this sleazy
Old hotel room
Doing this and that
To what and whom
Learning who you are,
Learning what I am.
Don't talk to me of love. Let's talk of Paris,
The little bit of Paris in our view.
There's that crack across the ceiling
And the hotel walls are peeling
And I'm in Paris with you.
Don't talk to me of love. Let's talk of Paris.
I'm in Paris with the slightest thing you do.
I'm in Paris with your eyes, your mouth,
I'm in Paris with... all points south.
Am I embarrassing you?
I'm in Paris with you.

'In Paris, at the Louvre, there have I seen
The sumptuously-feathered angel pierce
Prone Lucifer, descending. Looked he fierce,
Showing the fight a fair one? Too serene!
The young Pharsalians did not disarray
Less willingly their locks of floating silk:
That suckling mouth of his, upon the milk
Of heaven might still be feasting through the fray.
Oh, Raphael! when men the Fiend do fight,
They conquer not upon such easy terms.
Half serpent in the struggle grow these worms
And does he grow half human, all is right.'
This to my Lady in a distant spot,
Upon the theme: While mind is mastering clay,
Gross clay invades it. If the spy you play,
My wife, read this! Strange love talk, is it not?

Paris Autumn
Leaving home in bitter cold
I waited for you at a small café
Red wine overflew my glass.
Rainy night Autumn
Familiar old streets and sidewalks
Leaves dropped on the park
Patiently, I waited for you, minutes then hours.
Silent Autumn
Beside Luxembourg garden
I waited for you on familiar stone bench.
Without you, my heart was frozen.
Where are you in Autumn?
My friend of brown eyes
And of fine blond hair
My fruit of sadness has red-ripened by awaiting.
Paris Autumn
Overflowing eyelids
My dorm girlfriend
Sneaked in with soft steps and whispers.
Voiceless Autumn
Fading lipstick on the lips
You returned with sadness
Forgetting bitterness, we amended our lives.
Autumn! Autumn!
Shady sky with low hanging clouds
With my generous loving heart
I have waited for you with my imprisoned heart and mind.
Autumn! ... Oh God! Autumn love!

Above poem is English translation of original Vietnamese poem of CUNG TRẦM TƯỞNG:
MÙA THU PARIS
Mùa thu Paris
Trời buốt ra đi
Hẹn em quán nhỏ
Rưng rưng rượu đỏ tràn ly
Mùa thu đêm mưa
Phố cũ hè xưa
Công trường lá đổ
Ngóng em kiên khổ phút, giờ
Mùa thu âm thầm
Bên vườn Lục-Xâm
Ngồi quen ghế đá
Không em buốt gía từ tâm
Mùa thu nơi đâu?
Người em mắt nâu
Tóc vàng sợi nhỏ
Mong em chín đỏ trái sầu
Mùa thu Paris
Tràn dâng đôi mi
Người em gác trọ
Sang anh, gót nhỏ thầm thì
Mùa thu không lời
Son nhạt đôi môi
Em buồn trở lại
Hờn quên, hối cải cuộc đời
Mùa thu! mùa thu
Mây trời âm u
Yêu người độ lượng
Trông em tâm tưởng, giam tù
Mùa thu! ... Trời ơi! Tình thu!
CUNG TRẦM TƯỞNG

Prends ma main, Voyageur, et montons sur la Tour. -
Regarde tout en bas, et regarde à l'entour.
Regarde jusqu'au bout de l'horizon, regarde
Du nord au sud. Partout où ton oeil se hasarde,
Qu'il s'attache avec feu, comme l'oeil du serpent
Qui pompe du regard ce qu'il suit en rampant,
Tourne sur le donjon qu'un parapet prolonge,
D'où la vue à loisir sur tous les points se plonge
Et règne, du zénith, sur un monde mouvant,
Comme l'éclair, l'oiseau, le nuage et le vent.
Que vois-tu dans la nuit, à nos pieds, dans l'espace,
Et partout où mon doigt tourne, passe et repasse ?
- ' Je vois un cercle noir, si large et si profond
' Que je n'en aperçois ni le bout ni le fond.
' Des collines, au loin, me semblent sa ceinture,
' Et, pourtant, je ne vois nulle part la nature,
' Mais partout la main d'homme et l'angle que sa main
' Impose à la matière en tout travail humain.
' Je vois ces angles noirs et luisants qui, dans l'ombre,
' L'un sur l'autre entassés, sans ordre ni sans nombre
' Coupent des murs blanchis pareils à des tombeaux.
' - Je vois fumer, brûler, éclater des flambeaux,
' Brillant sur cet abîme où l'air pénètre à peine,
' Comme des diamants incrustés dans l'ébène.
' - Un fleuve y dort sans bruit, replié dans son cours,
' Comme, dans un buisson, la couleuvre aux cent tours.
' Des ombres de palais, de dômes et d'aiguilles,
' De tours et de donjons, de clochers, de bastilles
' De châteaux forts, de kiosks et d'aigus minarets ;
' Des formes de remparts, de jardins, de forêts,
' De spirales, d'arceaux, de parcs, de colonnades,
' D'obélisques, de ponts, de portes et d'arcades,
' Tout fourmille et grandit, se cramponne en montant,
' Se courbe, se replie, ou se creuse ou s'étend.
' - Dans un brouillard de feu je crois voir ce grand rêve.
' La tour où nous voilà dans le cercle s'élève.
' En le traçant jadis, c'est ici, n'est-ce pas,
' Que Dieu même a posé le centre du compas ?
' Le vertige m'enivre, et sur mes yeux il pèse.
' Vois-je une Roue ardente, ou bien une Fournaise ? '

Jeg gaar og gaar
ad brede Gader og i snævre Gyder,
i Parker, fyldte ad den grønne Vaar,
hvor Rododendren tung af Blomster staar
og Springvand syder,
— gaar milevidt
ad Boulevarder, hvor for hvert et Skridt
Kastanjeblomster som smaa Snefnug ligge
— gaar alle Vegne
hvor hundred Gange jeg i Drømme gik,
... og glædes ikke.
Paris! Paris!
— mit Liv sin Farve fik
i andre Egne.
Du rige Stad!
Svøbt som en Fe i Vaarens Blomsterklæde
strør du din Pragt til den, som smiler glad,
din Sjæl, dit Liv, Dugdraaben, som et Blad
har du grædt af Glæde.
Og den, der ser
en Morgenstund, naar alle Smaabørn ler,
hvor Solen som et Væld af Kærtegn glider
— fra dine Hænder,
— han rammes af et Sting,
som Hjærtet bider.
Paris! Paris!
jeg længes efter Ting,
du ikke kender.

That which Grecian art created,
Let the Frank, with joy elated,
Bear to Seine's triumphant strand,
And in his museums glorious
Show the trophies all-victorious
To his wondering fatherland.
They to him are silent ever,
Into life's fresh circle never
From their pedestals come down.
He alone e'er holds the Muses
Through whose breast their power diffuses,--
To the Vandal they're but stone!

Paris spring
street by street we explore
the city like a flower
Paris spring
slowly but surely the city
blooms in us
Paris spring
foot by foot
we explore the city
Eiffel Tower spring
the city lights up
our dreams
Eiffel Tower spring
the city spreads out
like our dreams
They say springtime in Paris is the stuff of songs, daydreams, and romance novels. And there is a heavy dose of truth to that. Cruise the Seine River, admire art at the Louvre and the Musée d'Orsay, and see the quintessential Parisian sights of the Arc de Triomphe and Notre Dame. Enjoy a good book and coffee at a café on the Champs-Elysées, have a picnic of fresh bread and cheese in the Tuileries Garden, or take in a dinner show at The Moulin Rouge. Cap off your trip with an evening ascent up the Eiffel Tower to witness the City of Lights in full glory.

Untie the knot for me
of your deep inner secrets....
Give me the key
of your inner fantasies
where u have been drowning....
Let me swim in the sea
of your dreams, desires and longings....
Let me unravel the mysteries
of your mind
thats made you blind
thats been raging in you
tormenting you
spending you
lusting in you
bursting in you.
Come...
touch me
and feel the peace
walk into your soul....
The storm will cease.
Feel the calm
like a balm.
Stop searching
and yearning.
Feel my aura...
Embrace it
If you hug me close
you can share it....

Lets drink the wine of love...
Swirl it and soak it in...
Smell the fragrance
Mmm...and the scent of heaven
A song in our hearts
Smile in the eyes
Love to keep us fulfilled
For the rest of our lives...
Soar out to our dreams
Swim out from the streams
To join the ocean of love
And discover...
The world of paradise.

I was drunk with the sobriety of my love
Wandering with a passion of a possessed soul
Swimming in the azure waters of my wonderous cove
Thought that I had discovered love that was whole
In your light, the rays that touched me set me ablaze
Torching a flame in my heart, urging a song
To give, to surrender, to live forever in this love haze
And to live in this radiant light for as long
as the fire crackled in this warm universe
and the monsoon made love to this thirsty earth
Drenched in this ecstasy, I let the beauty dance
Unleashing a rapturous force that shook my soul
Breathing new life in me with just one of your glance
Words pouring out to celebrate this romance
In this dawn of hope, he came with a searing kiss
And woke me up from this languid dream
where I had got lost in the timeless bliss
Now completely awake, dazzled by the sunbeams
Groping in the darkness of my subconscious
All I remembered, t'was a dream...so sensuous

Let me take you hold your body in my arms
Kissing those tender lips long and deep
Can you Feel my passion rise
Let us make love all through the night
Quickly decide, we must not waste a minute of time
Deftly remove all my clothes
Slowly I begin to caress your soft skin
My fingertips start to wander
Feeling the softness of you
Those tender breasts draw my fingers to them
Touching and stroking them
Covering your body with kisses
Over the curve of the breasts
Slowly reaching the nipples peak
Sucking with greedy abandon
The heat of our bodies rapidly rising
Breathing starts to increase
Panting harder wanting you now
Your body inviting
Moulding itself into mine
Thighs parted anticipating
Requesting my body’s presence
Obligingly I settle between them
Connecting to you
So slowly at first bodies moving in time
Reaching deeper into the depths of passion
Increasing the rate of heated attack
Faster rapier like movements
Lust consuming us both
Animalistic instincts taking over
Both wanting our own pleasure
Minds blocked to all other thoughts
Oh the passion
Faster we ride our primeval lust
Peaking explosively together
Tasted the essence of passion
Screaming my name in orgasm
Your body bucks with mine
We are as one, engulfed in each other

Mirrored echoes dance, shades leave behind
Upward spiral, circle higher still.
Shadow personae played out, heart and will,
Inside and out reflect hopes redefined.
Can this light true remain or wane? We find
At last trace of shared space to dreams fulfill.
Now answer Dear, do you, too, warm and chill?
Depth of feeling freed, hearts need to bind,
Passion parallel, to urge aligned,
As one, - tendril touching - surging thrill,
Sensations soothing dissonance to still
Secret fears, time's sentence purged, demined.
In gentleness soul strokes soul til release
ON wings of comfort comes, whole makes each piece.
Ph[r]ase by ph[r]ase, souls tenderly tendril,
Answer questions. Sun beneath the skin
Sensations warms, blood pulses fast to win
Satisfaction which can Trust instill.
In gentless soul strokes twin soul until
Only smiles sleep comforts, kin find kin.
No dream is this, which daylight will wear thin!
At last trace of shared space may dreams fulfill.
Now must your answer show our overspill!
Depth of feeling, harmony, begin
Mirrored dance where darkness seems a sin.
Upwards two halves united spin - no chill
Shadow portends which could kill - love unshared.
I, Charmed, disarmed, am for your smile prepared

The play of passion
in her eyes is
not lost on him
Looking to see what
is not there and
wonders who is she
Searching through each
other and find nothing
yet taste every feeling
Seeing into each
other and suddenly
need to turn away
Soft kiss touches on
his cheek and he
knows nothing is lost,
Never to be found again
***

Give me such Passion
That it knows no end
Let my heart grow wings
And take flight again
Allow me such love
That I feel with each embrace
Overwhelming fires
That grow with the thrill of chase
Grant me such a kiss
That my heart escapes my chest
Such a beating against my ribs
That my pain tolerance is at test
Bestow upon me such Passion
That nothing else exists
Warm me with your arms
Bless me with your lips
Touch me with such tenderness
That I cannot believe
That such Passion could exist
Inside someone like me

Taking your hand
fingers touch my lips
I want to love every inch of you
taste every part of you
to drink your love
through your very pores
Lay down beside me
feel my body crying for you
I want to get lost...
your sweet caresses
touching my soul
Want me, like no other
need me, like air
join me to make one mind, one soul
fused in the heat of passion
existing in this moment

She seductively sat
Upon my lap like a child,
Like a kindergartner
With proud innocent curls
On a sexy, naïve evening.
She placed her fingers on my lips,
She then pressed
Her whole hand
Against my chest,
She traveled south
And gave the slightest
Intoxicating touch
To my sensitive region.
We embraced
By soft October bridges
In the dark, romantic wine-glass night,
She told me not to speak,
Just to think wordless prayers.
And kiss her with unreserved passion.

The church bells are ringing incessantly
Alerting earthlings to join the pilgrimage to pray
Across the sea, mountains and desert wastes,
With peaceful nations and those who went astray.
Oh! glorious church bells throughout the world,
Ring, ring, ring your tidings of everlasting peace,
Proclaim the destiny and imminent end of humankind,
If hatred and hostilities among nations don't cease.
The splendid, angelic chorus in the realm of heaven
Will in unison join the church bells in a peaceful song,
And the Supreme Maker will look down in silent awe,
Upon the massive gathering of a peace seeking throng.
Peace is the objective, as the Supreme Maker smiles,
And the angels prepare graciously to stand aside
To observe all the earthlings worship and pray freely,
Where peace and love should always abide.

I many times thought Peace had come
When Peace was far away—
As Wrecked Men—deem they sight the Land—
At Centre of the Sea—
And struggle slacker—but to prove
As hopelessly as I—
How many the fictitious Shores—
Before the Harbor be—

My love for you,
How rich in depth?
For joy to cherish,
For peace to restore,
For presence to make known,
My love to engulf!
Fireworks on candles,
Roses embedded beneath.
For love so pure,
For joy to rejoice,
For peace to uphold,
For presence to overwhelm,
My love to sparkle!
Lilies on a river,
Chandelier on the sky.
For love so innocent,
For joy to compel,
For peace to touch,
For presence to gaze,
My love till death will reign!

When darkness long has veil'd my mind,
And smiling day once more appears,
Then, my Redeemer, then I find
The folly of my doubts and fears.
Straight I upbraid my wandering heart,
And blush that I should ever be
Thus prone to act so base a part,
Or harbour one hard thought of Thee!
Oh! let me then at length be taught
What I am still so slow to learn,
That God is love, and changes not,
Nor knows the shadow of a turn.
Sweet truth, and easy to repeat!
But when my faith is sharply tried,
I find myself a learner yet,
Unskilful, weak, and apt to slide.
But, O my Lord, one look from Thee
Subdues the disobedient will,
Drives doubt and discontent away,
And Thy rebellious worm is still.
Thou art as ready to forgive
As I am ready to repine;
Thou, therefore, all the praise receive;
Be shame and self-abhorrence mine.

The poor young girl
with beach blonde hair
and pale white skin
stands in the middle of the street,
in the middle of a war.
Her face shows pain,
her face shows she wants help.
She goes to the hardware store
and steals a can of purple paint.
She doesn't know better,
so it doesn't matter.
The pale girl opens the can of purple paint
and uses her hands to write a message on the
big brick building wall.
She uses what knowledge she has of spelling,
and traces her purple paint covered fingers
over the wall.
First she draws a P
than an E
than she dips her hand back in the paint.
When she is done with the word,
the purple paint has run down the wall,
but you could still see the word very clearly.
It spelled PEACE.
The young girl takes her hand and presses it to the wall
leaving a very small purple handprint.
Then she runs.
A soldier calls after her,
'Peace little girl, Peace! '

Suddenly bells and flags!
Suddenly -- door to door --
Tidings!  Can we believe,
We, who were used to war?
Yet we have dreamed her face,
Knowing her light must be,
Knowing that she must come.
Look -- she comes, it is she!
Tattered her raiment floats,
Blood is upon her wings.
Ah, but her eyes are clear!
Ah, but her voice outrings!
Soon where the shrapnel fell
Petals shall wake and stir.
Look -- she is here, she lives!
Beauty has died for her.

AH, that Time could touch a form
That could show what Homer's age
Bred to be a hero's wage.
'Were not all her life but storm
Would not painters paint a form
Of such noble lines,' I said,
'Such a delicate high head,
All that sternness amid charm,
All that sweetness amid strength?'
Ah, but peace that comes at length,
Came when Time had touched her form.

I opened the ink-well and smoke filled the room.
The smoke formed the giant frog-cat of my doom.
His web feet left dreadful slime tracks on the floor.
He had hammer and nails that he laid by the door.
He sprawled on the table, claw-hands in my hair.
He looked through my heart to the mud that was there.
Like a black-mailer hating his victim he spoke:
"When I see all your squirming I laugh till I choke
Singing of peace. Railing at battle.
Soothing a handful with saccharine prattle.
All the millions of earth have voted for fight.
You are voting for talk, with hands lily white."
He leaped to the floor, then grew seven feet high,
Beautiful, terrible, scorn in his eye:
The Devil Eternal, Apollo grown old,
With beard of bright silver and garments of gold.
"What will you do to end war for good?
Will you stand by the book-case, be nailed to the wood?"
I stretched out my arms. He drove the nails deep,
Silently, coolly. The house was asleep,
I hung for three years, forbidden to die.
I seemed but a shadow the servants passed by.
At the end of the time with hot irons he returned.
"The Quitter Sublime" on my bosom he burned.
As he seared me he hissed: "You are wearing away.
The good angels tell me you leave them today.
You want to come down from the nails in the door.
The victor must hang there three hundred years more.
If any prig-saint would outvote all mankind
He must use an immortally resolute mind.
Think what the saints of Benares endure,
Through infinite birthpangs their courage is sure.
Self-tortured, self-ruled, they build their powers high,
Until they are gods, overmaster the sky."
Then he pulled out the nails. He shouted "Come in."
To heal me there stepped in a lady of sin.
Her hand was in mine. We walked in the sun.
She said: "Now forget them, the Saxon and Hun.
You are dreary and aged and silly and weak.
Let us smell the sweet groves. Let the summertime speak."
We walked to the river. We swam there in state.
I was a serpent. She was my mate.
I forgot in the marsh, as I tumbled about,
That trial in my room, where I did not hold out.
Since I was a serpent, my mate seemed to me
As a mermaiden seems to a fisher at sea,
Or a whisky soaked girl to a whisky soaked king.
I woke. She had turned to a ravening thing
On the table — a buzzard with leperous head.
She tore up my rhymes and my drawings. She said:
"I am your own cheap bankrupt soul.
Will you die for the nations, making them whole?
We joy in the swamp and here we are gay.
Will you bring your fine peace to the nations today?"

IF Michael, leader of God's host
When Heaven and Hell are met,
Looked down on you from Heaven's door-post
He would his deeds forget.
Brooding no more upon God's wars
In his divine homestead,
He would go weave out of the stars
A chaplet for your head.
And all folk seeing him bow down,
And white stars tell your praise,
Would come at last to God's great town,
Led on by gentle ways;
And God would bid His warfare cease,
Saying all things were well;
And softly make a rosy peace,
A peace of Heaven with Hell.

An umbrella being dragged at the day's end.
A seagull churns its wings,
avoiding sunlight,
the hard flight of Icarus.
Pink swimsuits blown in the wind,
in search of due course.
Time is needy, a bronzed babe walks by, a regular
statue of Liberty, her flesh turning to
green palor as the water cools.
In this empty beach dream of deepening sky,
the wet Kremlin and White House
are eroded as our childless hopes.
An old woman collects
seashells-caverns of poverty
to be sold to our deaf ears.
The ocean roars of stolen property.

How am I supposed to be myself, Daddy
When you want me to be someone else?
How am I supposed to act like nothing fazes me, Daddy
When you're the one that breaks me down?
How am I supposed to be strong, Daddy
When you're the one that makes me weak?
How am I supposed to love, Daddy
If you're the one that teaches me to hate?
How am I supposed to care, Daddy
If you dont even care at all?
How am I supposed to spread my wings and fly, Daddy
If you keep me in this cage?
How am I supposed to leave, Daddy
If you never let me go?
Tell me,
Daddy......
How?

When you leave me
I feel wounded, uneasy and yet unshaken
I feel sad, unhappy but never forsaken.
Why this happens
Do you ever know that?
I feel overwhelmed with the sky
With the rainbow  above.
I drank the cup
To the last drop
As I felt unquenchable thirst
Of Love…..
I know you never left me alone.
You remain with me for ever
You ever brightly shone
You can leave me never, never.
We have found each other
Discovered all the sweetness under the sun
After all the enquiry I have  made,
You simply made of it a fun.
Do you at all know?
What  your eyes with tears did  show
My love for you was a sacred vow.
I saw in your eyes
A  pink pink rose
What is its exact colour
Nobody but me knows.

Pretty as a picture
In her brand new summer dress;
Not that she is interested,
Kids love to make a mess.
(Written April 2014)

Do not text me or think otherwise
I am just picking flowers from my garden.
Last evening I picked a red rose but
Wow! It proved to be too red for my date
Today I visited the same garden
The only flower I found was a white rose.
Where is my favourite pink rose?
This morning I cycled to the market
Sure, to buy my date a pink rose
But the only roses there were yellow and purple.
Tried to enquire where I could get one
But no one knows where to find.
Went to my flower vendor but nowhere to find
Where will I get my pink rose for my date?
Tomorrow, I'll travel far and wide
Only to get this precious pink flower
And if I succeed, my date will be happy
And my heart will find a solace rest
Amidst the residue of love petals
Just with the pink flower petals.
Where will I get my Pink rose flower?
(Dedicated for my pink flower date)

The Pink butterfly
looking like pink shirts,
My pink thoughts
looking like mom's skirt
My inner soul
has a pink ink
love is pink
from the cry of a baby in the sink
pink is nice
I love it to savory perfection
Pink is a man's color
I make it my selection
Pink is the star
that is iridescent
its a half moon
called a crescent
-Pink-

Pink ribbons span the evening sky
And trim your feathered bed
Now I will sing a lullaby
Lay down your sleepy head
You are the universal child
You, the child of the world
Born as to be yet sweet and mild
With hair that`s softly curled
The world has seen another day
The earth has turned again
The birds have watched you laugh and play
Betwixt the sun and rain
You are the universal child
You, the child of the world
By Mother Nature you are styled
In whom the rest are furled
The world has passed yet slowly by
This earth so turned in vain
For, sorrowing, it saw you cry
And felt your silent pain
You are the universal child
You, the child of the world
I pray you'll never be defiled
Nor fear at you be hurled

lives in thorne
smiles in thorne
sleeps on thorne
yet never cries
of her sufferings
Her each petal are more soft
than ever in creation
Her aroma applaudes
recites anthology of fragnance
though laithful
but never hides her beauty
her obesance quantify her beauty
morning breeze cherish
to have a bathe with her tulle pollen
so blows softly and cool
She is indubious in all seasons
In return the sun  confers her
his pink to make her pink
to make her pink
So, rose is pink

I may walk until I’m fainting, I may write until I’m blinded,
I might drink until my back teeth are afloat,
But I can’t forget my ruin and the happy days behind it,
When I wore a pink carnation in my coat.
Oh, I thought that time could conquer, and I thought my heart would harden,
But it sends a sudden lump into my throat,
When I think of what I have been, and the cottage and the garden,
When I wore a pink carnation in my coat.
God forgive you, girl, and bless you! Let no line of mine distress you –
I am sorry for the bitter lines I wrote;
But remember, and think kindly, for we met and married blindly,
When I wore a pink carnation in my coat.

The deck of an ancient ship.  At the right of the stage is the mast, with a large square sail hiding a great deal of the sky and sea on that side.  The tiller is at the left of the stage; it is a long oar coming through an opening in the bulwark.  The deck rises in a series of steps hehind the tiller, and the stern of the ship curves overhead.  When the play opens there are four persons upon the deck.  Aibric stands by the tiller.  Forgael sleeps upon the raised portion of the deck towards the front of the stage.  Two Sailors are standing near to the mast, on which a harp is hanging.
First Sailor. Has he not led us into these waste seas
For long enough?
Second Sailor. Aye, long and long enough.
First Sailor. We have not come upon a shore or ship
These dozen weeks.
Sccond Sailor. And I had thought to make
A good round Sum upon this cruise, and turn --
For I am getting on in life -- to something
That has less ups and downs than robbery.
First Sailor. I am so tired of being bachelor
I could give all my heart to that Red Moll
That had but the one eye.
Second Sailor. Can no bewitchment
Transform these rascal billows into women
That I may drown myself?
First Sailor. Better steer home,
Whether he will or no; and better still
To take him while he sleeps and carry him
And drop him from the gunnel.
Second Sailor. I dare not do it.
Were't not that there is magic in his harp,
I would be of your mind; but when he plays it
Strange creatures flutter up before one's eyes,
Or cry about one's ears.
First Sailor. Nothing to fear.
Second Sailor. Do you remember when we sank that
galley
At the full moon?
First Sailor. He played all through the night.
Second Sailor. Until the moon had set; and when I looked
Where the dead drifted, I could see a bird
Like a grey gull upon the breast of each.
While I was looking they rose hurriedly,
And after circling with strange cries awhile
Flew westward; and many a time since then
I've heard a rustling overhead in the wind.
First Sailor. I saw them on that night as well as you.
But when I had eaten and drunk myself asleep
My courage came again.
Second Sailor. But that's not all.
The other night, while he was playing it,
A beautiful young man and girl came up
In a white breaking wave; they had the look
Of those that are alive for ever and ever.
First Sailor. I saw them, too, one night.  Forgael was
playing,
And they were listening ther& beyond the sail.
He could not see them, but I held out my hands
To grasp the woman.
Second Sailor. You have dared to touch her?
First Sailor. O she was but a shadow, and slipped from
me.
Second Sailor. But were you not afraid?
First Sailor. Why should I fear?
Second Sailor. 'Twas Aengus and Edain, the wandering
lovers,
To whom all lovers pray.
First Sailor. But what of that?
A shadow does not carry sword or spear.
Second Sailor. My mother told me that there is not one
Of the Ever-living half so dangerous
As that wild Aengus.  Long before her day
He carried Edain off from a king's house,
And hid her among fruits of jewel-stone
And in a tower of glass, and from that day
Has hated every man that's not in love,
And has been dangerous to him.
First Sailor. I have heard
He does not hate seafarers as he hates
Peaceable men that shut the wind away,
And keep to the one weary marriage-bed.
Second Sailor. I think that he has Forgael in his net,
And drags him through the sea,
First Sailor Well, net or none,
I'd drown him while we have the chance to do it.
Second Sailor. It's certain I'd sleep easier o' nights
If he were dead; but who will be our captain,
Judge of the stars, and find a course for us?
First Sailor. I've thought of that.  We must have Aibric
with us,
For he can judge the stars as well as Forgael.
[Going towards Aibric.]
Become our captain, Aibric.  I am resolved
To make an end of Forgael while he sleeps.
There's not a man but will be glad of it
When it is over, nor one to grumble at us.
Aibric. You have taken pay and made your bargain for it.
First Sailor. What good is there in this hard way of
living,
Unless we drain more flagons in a year
And kiss more lips than lasting peaceable men
In their long lives? Will you be of our troop
And take the captain's share of everything
And bring us into populous seas again?
Aibric. Be of your troop! Aibric be one of you
And Forgael in the other scale! kill Forgael,
And he my master from my childhood up!
If you will draw that sword out of its scabbard
I'll give my answer.
First Sailor. You have awakened him.
[To Second Sailor.]
We'd better go, for we have lost this chance.
[They go out.]
Forgael. Have the birds passed us? I could hear your
voice,
But there were others.
Aibric. I have seen nothing pass.
Forgael. You're certain of it? I never wake from sleep
But that I am afraid they may have passed,
For they're my only pilots.  If I lost them
Straying too far into the north or south,
I'd never come upon the happiness
That has been promised me.  I have not seen them
These many days; and yet there must be many
Dying at every moment in the world,
And flying towards their peace.
Aibric. Put by these thoughts,
And listen to me for a while.  The sailors
Are plotting for your death.
Forgael. Have I not given
More riches than they ever hoped to find?
And now they will not follow, while I seek
The only riches that have hit my fancy.
Aibric. What riches can you find in this waste sea
Where no ship sails, where nothing that's alive
Has ever come but those man-headed birds,
Knowing it for the world's end?
Forgael. Where the world ends
The mind is made unchanging, for it finds
Miracle, ecstasy, the impossible hope,
The flagstone under all, the fire of fires,
The roots of the world.
Aibric. Shadows before now
Have driven travellers mad for their own sport.
Forgael. Do you, too, doubt me? Have you joined their
plot?
Aibric. No, no, do not say that.  You know right well
That I will never lift a hand against you.
Forgael. Why should you be more faithful than the rest,
Being as doubtful?
Aibric. I have called you master
Too many years to lift a hand against you.
Forgael. Maybe it is but natural to doubt me.
You've never known, I'd lay a wager on it,
A melancholy that a cup of wine,
A lucky battle, or a woman's kiss
Could not amend.
Aibric. I have good spirits enough.
Forgael. If you will give me all your mind awhile --
All, all, the very bottom of the bowl --
I'll show you that I am made differently,
That nothing can amend it but these waters,
Where I am rid of life -- the events of the world --
What do you call it? -- that old promise-breaker,
The cozening fortune-teller that comes whispering,
'You will have all you have wished for when you have
earned
Land for your children or money in a pot.-
And when we have it we are no happier,
Because of that old draught under the door,
Or creaky shoes.  And at the end of all
How are we better off than Seaghan the fool,
That never did a hand's turn? Aibric! Aibric!
We have fallen in the dreams the Ever-living
Breathe on the burnished mirror of the world
And then smooth out with ivory hands and sigh,
And find their laughter sweeter to the taste
For that brief sighing.
Aibric. If you had loved some woman --
Forgael. You say that also? You have heard the voices,
For that is what they say -- all, all the shadows --
Aengus and Edain, those passionate wanderers,
And all the others; but it must be love
As they have known it.  Now the secret's out;
For it is love that I am seeking for,
But of a beautiful, unheard-of kind
That is not in the world.
Aibric. And yet the world
Has beautiful women to please every man.
Forgael. But he that gets their love after the fashion
'Loves in brief longing and deceiving hope
And bodily tenderness, and finds that even
The bed of love, that in the imagination
Had seemed to be the giver of all peace,
Is no more than a wine-cup in the tasting,
And as soon finished.
Aibric. All that ever loved
Have loved that way -- there is no other way.
Forgael. Yet never have two lovers kissed but they
believed there was some other near at hand,
And almost wept because they could not find it.
Aibric. When they have twenty years; in middle life
They take a kiss for what a kiss is worth,
And let the dream go by.
Forgael. It's not a dream,
But the reality that makes our passion
As a lamp shadow -- no -- no lamp, the sun.
What the world's million lips are thirsting for
Must be substantial somewhere.
Aibric. I have heard the Druids
Mutter such things as they awake from trance.
It may be that the Ever-living know it --
No mortal can.
Forgael. Yes; if they give us help.
Aibric. They are besotting you as they besot
The crazy herdsman that will tell his fellows
That he has been all night upon the hills,
Riding to hurley, or in the battle-host
With the Ever-living.
Forgael. What if he speak the truth,
And for a dozen hours have been a part
Of that more powerful life?
Aibric, His wife knows better.
Has she not seen him lying like a log,
Or fumbling in a dream about the house?
And if she hear him mutter of wild riders,
She knows that it was but the cart-horse coughing
That set him to the fancy.
Forgael. All would be well
Could we but give us wholly to the dreams,
And get into their world that to the sense
Is shadow, and not linger wretchedly
Among substantial things; for it is dreams
That lift us to the flowing, changing world
That the heart longs for.  What is love itself,
Even though it be the lightest of light love,
But dreams that hurry from beyond the world
To make low laughter more than meat and drink,
Though it but set us sighing? Fellow-wanderer,
Could we but mix ourselves into a dream,
Not in its image on the mirror!
Aibric. While
We're in the body that's impossible.
Forgael. And yet I cannot think they're leading me
To death; for they that promised to me love
As those that can outlive the moon have known it, '
Had the world's total life gathered up, it seemed,
Into their shining limbs -- I've had great teachers.
Aengus and Edain ran up out of the wave --
You'd never doubt that it was life they promised
Had you looked on them face to face as I did,
With so red lips, and running on such feet,
And having such wide-open, shining eyes.
Aibric. It's certain they are leading you to death.
None but the dead, or those that never lived,
Can know that ecstasy.  Forgael! Forgael!
They have made you follow the man-headed birds,
And you have told me that their journey lies
Towards the country of the dead.
Forgael. What matter
If I am going to my death? -- for there,
Or somewhere, I shall find the love they have
promised.
That much is certain.  I shall find a woman.
One of the Ever-living, as I think --
One of the Laughing People -- and she and I
Shall light upon a place in the world's core,
Where passion grows to be a changeless thing,
Like charmed apples made of chrysoprase,
Or chrysoberyl, or beryl, or chrysclite;
And there, in juggleries of sight and sense,
Become one movement, energy, delight,
Until the overburthened moon is dead.
[A number of Sailors entcr hurriedly.]
First Sailor. Look there! there in the mist! a ship of spice!
And we are almost on her!
Second Sailor. We had not known
But for the ambergris and sandalwood.
First Sailor. NO; but opoponax and cinnamon.
Forgael [taking the tiller from Aibric]. The Ever-living have
kept my bargain for me,
And paid you on the nail.
Aibric. Take up that rope
To make her fast while we are plundering her.
First Sailor. There is a king and queen upon her deck,
And where there is one woman there'll be others.
Aibric. Speak lower, or they'll hear.
First Sailor. They cannot hear;
They are too busy with each other.  Look!
He has stooped down and kissed her on the lips.
Second Sailor. When she finds out we have better men
aboard
She may not be too sorry in the end.
First Sailor. She will be like a wild cat; for these queens
Care more about the kegs of silver and gold
And the high fame that come to them in marriage,
Than a strong body and a ready hand.
Second Sailor. There's nobody is natural but a robber,
And that is why the world totters about
Upon its bandy legs.
Aibric. Run at them now,
And overpower the crew while yet asleep!
[The Sailors go out.]
<1[Voices and thc clashing of swords are heard from the
other ship, which cannot be seen because of the sail.]
A Voice. Armed men have come upon us! O I am slain!
Another Voice. Wake all below!
Another Voice. Why have you broken our sleep?
First Voice. Armed men have come upon us! O I am
slain!
Forgael [who has remained at the tiller]. There! there they
come! Gull, gannet, or diver,
But with a man's head, or a fair woman's,
They hover over the masthead awhile
To wait their Fiends; but when their friends have
come
They'll fly upon that secret way of theirs.
One -- and one -- a couple -- five together;
And I will hear them talking in a minute.
Yes, voices! but I do not catch the words.
Now I can hear.  There's one of them that says,
'How light we are, now we are changed to birds!'
Another answers, 'Maybe we shall find
Our heart's desire now that we are so light.'
And then one asks another how he died,
And says, 'A sword-blade pierced me in my sleep.-
And now they all wheel suddenly and fly
To the other side, and higher in the air.
And now a laggard with a woman's head
dGmes crying, 'I have run upon the sword.
I have fled to my beloved in the air,
In the waste of the high air, that we may wander
Among the windy meadows of the dawn.'
But why are they still waiting? why are they
Circling and circling over the masthead?
What power that is more mighty than desire
To hurry to their hidden happiness
Withholds them now? Have the Ever-living Ones
A meaning in that circling overhead?
But what's the meaning? [He cries out.] Why do you
linger there?
Why linger? Run to your desire,
Are you not happy winged bodies now?
[His voice sinks again.]
Being too busy in the air and the high air,
They cannot hear my voice; but what's the meaning?
<1[The Sailors have returned.  Dectora is with them.]
Forgael [turning and seeing her].>1 Why are you standing
with your eyes upon me?
You are not the world's core.  O no, no, no!
That cannot be the meaning of the birds.
You are not its core.  My teeth are in the world,
But have not bitten yet.
Dectora. I am a queen,
And ask for satisfaction upon these
Who have slain my husband and laid hands upon me.
[Breaking loose from the Sailors who are holding her.]
Let go my hands!
Forgael. Why do you cast a shadow?
Where do you come from? Who brought you to this
place?
They would not send me one that casts a shadow.
Dectora. Would that the storm that overthrew my ships,
And drowned the treasures of nine conquered nations,
And blew me hither to my lasting sorrow,
Had drowned me also.  But, being yet alive,
I ask a fitting punishment for all
That raised their hands against him.
Forgael. There are some
That weigh and measure all in these waste seas --
They that have all the wisdom that's in life,
And all that prophesying images
Made of dim gold rave out in secret tombs;
They have it that the plans of kings and queens
But laughter and tears -- laughter, laughter, and tears;
That every man should carry his own soul
Upon his shoulders.
Dectora. You've nothing but wild words,
And I would know if you will give me vengeance.
Forgael. When she finds out I will not let her go --
When she knows that.
Dectora. What is it that you are muttering --
That you'll not let me go? I am a queen.
Forgael. Although you are more beautiful than any,
I almost long that it were possible;
But if I were to put you on that ship,
With sailors that were sworn to do your will,
And you had spread a sail for home, a wind
Would rise of a sudden, or a wave so huge
It had washed among the stars and put them out,
And beat the bulwark of your ship on mine,
Until you stood before me on the deck --
As now.
Dectora. Does wandering in these desolate seas
And listening to the cry of wind and wave
Bring madness?
Forgael. Queen, I am not mad.
Dectora. Yet say
That unimaginable storms of wind and wave
Would rise against me.
Forgael. No, I am not mad --
If it be not that hearing messages
From lasting watchers, that outlive the moon,
At the most quiet midnight is to be stricken.
Dectora. And did those watchers bid you take me
captive?
Forgael. Both you and I are taken in the net.
It was their hands that plucked the winds awake
And blew you hither; and their mouths have
promised
I shall have love in their immortal fashion;
And for this end they gave me my old harp
That is more mighty than the sun and moon,
Or than the shivering casting-net of the stars,
That none might take you from me.
<1Dectora [first trembling back from the mast where the harp is,
and then laughing].>1 For a moment
Your raving of a message and a harp
More mighty than the stars half troubled me,
But all that's raving.  Who is there can compel
The daughter and the granddaughter of kings
To be his bedfellow?
Forgael. Until your lips
Have called me their beloved, I'll not kiss them.
Dectora. My husband and miy king died at my feet,
And yet you talk of love.
Forgael. The movement of time
Is shaken in these seas, and what one does
One moment has no might upon the moment
That follows after.
Dectora. I understand you now.
You have a Druid craft of wicked sound
Wrung from the cold women of the sea --
A magic that can call a demon up,
Until my body give you kiss for kiss.
Forgael. Your soul shall give the kiss.
Dectora. I am not afraid,
While there's a rope to run into a noose
Or wave to drown.  But I have done with words,
And I would have you look into my face
And know that it is fearless.
Forgael. Do what you will,
For neither I nor you can break a mesh
Of the great golden net that is about us.
Dectora. There's nothing in the world that's worth a
fear.
<1[She passes Forgael and stands for a moment looking into
his face.]>1
I have good reason for that thought.
[She runs suddenly on to the raiscd part of the poop.]
And now
I can put fear away as a queen should.
<1[She mounts on to the hulwark and turns towards
Forgael.]>1
Fool, fool! Although you have looked into my face
You do not see my purpose.  I shall have gone
Before a hand can touch me.
Forgael [folding his arms]. My hands are still;
The Ever-living hold us.  Do what you will,
You cannot leap out of the golden net.
First Sailor. No need to drown, for, if you will pardon
us
And measure out a course and bring us home,
We'll put this man to death.
Dectora. I promise it.
First Sailor. There is none to take his side.
Aibric. I am on his side,
I'll strike a blow for him to give him time
To cast his dreams away.
<1[Aibric goes in front of Forgael with drawn sword.  For-
gael takes the harp.]>1
First Sailor. No other'll do it.
<1[The Sailors throw Aibric on one side.  He falls and lies
upon the deck.  They lift their swords to strike Forgael,>1
<1who is about to play the harp.  The stage begins to
darken.  The Sailors hesitate in fear.]
Second Sailor.>1 He has put a sudden darkness over the
moon.
Dectora. Nine swords with handles of rhinoceros horn
To him that strikes him first!
First Sailor. I will strike him first.
<1[He goes close up to Forgael with his sword lifted.]
[Shrinking back.] He has caught the crescent moon out
of the sky,
And carries it between us.
Second Sailor. Holy fire
To burn us to the marrow if we strike.
Dectora. I'll give a golden galley full of fruit,
That has the heady flavour of new wine,
To him that wounds him to the death.
First Sailor. I'll do it.
For all his spells will vanish when he dies,
Having their life in him.
Second Sailor. Though it be the moon
That he is holding up between us there,
I will strike at him.
The Others. And I! And I! And I!
[Forgael plays the harp.]
First Sailor [falling into a dream suddenly. But you were
saying there is somebody
Upon that other ship we are to wake.
You did not know what brought him to his end,
But it was sudden.
Second Sailor. You are in the right;
I had forgotten that we must go wake him.
Dectora. He has flung a Druid spell upon the air,
And set you dreaming.
Second Sailor. How can we have a wake
When we have neither brown nor yellow ale?
First Sailor. I saw a flagon of brown ale aboard her.
Third Sailor. How can we raise the keen that do not
know
What name to call him by?
First Sailor. Come to his ship.
His name will come into our thoughts in a minute.
I know that he died a thousand years ago,
And has not yet been waked.
Second Sailor [beginning to keen]. Ohone! O! O! O!
The yew-bough has been broken into two,
And all the birds are scattered.
All the Sailors. O! O! O! O!
[They go out keening.]
Dectora. Protect me now, gods that my people swear by.
<1[Aibric has risen from the deck where he had fallen.  He
has begun looking for his sword as if in a dream.]>1
Aibric. Where is my sword that fell out of my hand
When I first heard the news? Ah, there it is!
<1[He goes dreamily towards the sword, but Dectora runs at
it and takes it up before he can reach it.]>1
Aibric [sleepily]. Queen, give it me.
Dectora. No, I have need of it.
Aibric. Why do you need a sword? But you may keep it.
Now that he's dead I have no need of it,
For everything is gone.
A Sailor [calling from the other ship]. Come hither, Aibric,
And tell me who it is that we are waking.
Aibric [half to Dectora, half to himself]. What name had
that dead king? Arthur of Britain?
No, no -- not Arthur.  I remember now.
It was golden-armed Iollan, and he died
Broken-hearted, having lost his queen
Through wicked spells.  That is not all the tale,
For he was killed.  O! O! O! O! O! O!
For golden-armed Iollan has been killed.
<1[He goes out.]
[While he has been speaking, and through part of what
follows, one hears the wailing of the Sailors from the
other ship.  Dectora stands with the sword lifted in
front of Forgael.]>1
Dectora. I will end all your magic on the instant.
<1[Her voice hecomes dreamy, and she lowers the sword
slowly, and finally lets it fall.  She spreads out her hair.
She takes off her crown and lays it upon the deck.]>1
This sword is to lie beside him in the grave.
It was in all his battles.  I will spread my hair,
And wring my hands, and wail him bitterly,
For I have heard that he was proud and laughing,
Blue-eyed, and a quick runner on bare feet,
And that he died a thousand years ago.
O; O! O! O!
[Forgael changes the tune.]
But no, that is not it.
They killed him at my feet.  O! O! O! O!
For golden-armed Iollan that I loved-
But what is it that made me say I loved him?
It was that harper put it in my thoughts,
But it is true.  Why did they run upon him,
And beat the golden helmet with their swords?
Forgael. Do you not know me, lady? I am he
That you are weeping for.
Dectora. No, for he is dcad.
O! O! O! O! for golden-armed Iollan.
Forgael. It was so given out, but I will prove
That the grave-diggers in a dreamy frenzy
Have buried nothing but my golden arms.
Listen to that low-laughing string of the moon
And you will recollect my face and voice,
For you have listened to me playing it
These thousand years.
<1[He starts up, listening to the birds.  The harp slips from
his hands, and remains leaning against the bulwarks
behind him.]>1
What are the birds at there?
Why are they all a-flutter of a sudden?
What are you calling out above the mast?
If railing and reproach and mockery
Because I have awakened her to love
By magic strings, I'll make this answer to it:
Being driven on by voices and by dreams
That were clear messages from the Ever-living,
I have done right.  What could I but obey?
And yet you make a clamour of reproach.
Dcctora [laughing]. Why, it's a wonder out of reckoning
That I should keen him from the full of the moon
To the horn, and he be hale and hearty.
Forgael. How have I wronged her now that she is merry?
But no, no, no! your cry is not against me.
You know the counsels of the Ever-living,
And all that tossing of your wings is joy,
And all that murmuring's but a marriage-song;
But if it be reproach, I answer this:
There is not one among you that made love
by any other means.  You call it passion,
Consideration, generosity;
But it was all deceit, and flattery
To win a woman in her own despite,
For love is war, and there is hatred in it;
And if you say that she came willingly --
Dectora. Why do you turn away and hide your face,
That I would look upon for ever?
Forgael. My grief!
Dectora. Have I not loved you for a thousand years?
Forgael. I never have been golden-armed Iollan.
Vectora. I do not understand.  I know your face
Better than my own hands.
Forgael. I have deceived you
Out of all reckoning.
Tectora. Is it not tme
That you were born a thousand years ago,
In islands where the children of Aengus wind
In happy dances under a windy moon,
And that you'll bring me there?
Forgael. I have deceived you;
I have deceived you utterly.
Dectora. How can that be?
Is it that though your eyes are full of love
Some other woman has a claim on you,
And I've but half!
Forgael. O no!
Dectora. And if there is,
If there be half a hundred more, what matter?
I'll never give another thought to it;
No, no, nor half a thought; but do not speak.
Women are hard and proud and stubborn-hearted,
Their heads being turned with praise and flattery;
And that is why their lovers are afraid
To tell them a plain story.
Forgael. That's not the story;
But I have done so great a wrong against you,
There is no measure that it would not burst.
I will confess it all.
Dectora. What do I care,
Now that my body has begun to dream,
And you have grown to be a burning sod
In the imagination and intellect?
If something that's most fabulous were true --
If you had taken me by magic spells,
And killed a lover or husband at my feet --
I would not let you speak, for I would know
That it was yesterday and not to-day
I loved him; I would cover up my ears,
As I am doing now.  [A pause.] Why do you weep?
Forgael. I weep because I've nothing for your eyes
But desolate waters and a battered ship.
Dectora. O why do you not lift your eyes to mine?
Forgael. I weep -- I weep because bare night's above,
And not a roof of ivory and gold.
Dectora. I would grow jealous of the ivory roof,
And strike the golden pillars with my hands.
I would that there was nothing in the world
But my beloved -- that night and day had perished,
And all that is and all that is to be,
All that is not the meeting of our lips.
Forgael. You turn away.  Why do you turn away?
Am I to fear the waves, or is the moon
My enemy?
Dectora. I looked upon the moon,
Longing to knead and pull it into shape
That I might lay it on your head as a crown.
But now it is your thoughts that wander away,
For you are looking at the sea.  Do you not know
How great a wrong it is to let one's thought
Wander a moment when one is in love?
<1[He has moved away.  She follows him.  He is looking out
over the sea, shading his eyes.]>1
Why are you looking at the sea?
Forgael. Look there!
Dectora. What is there but a troop of ash-grey birds
That fly into the west?
Forgael. But listen, listen!
Dectora. What is there but the crying of the birds?
Forgael. If you'll but listen closely to that crying
You'll hear them calling out to one another
With human voices
Dectora. O, I can hear them now.
What are they? Unto what country do they fly?
Forgael. To unimaginable happiness.
They have been circling over our heads in the air,
But now that they have taken to the road
We have to follow, for they are our pilots;
And though they're but the colour of grey ash,
They're crying out, could you but hear their words,
'There is a country at the end of the world
Where no child's born but to outlive the moon.'
<1[The Sailors comc in with Aibric.  They are in great
excitement.]>1
First Sailor. The hold is full of treasure.
Second Sailor. Full to the hatches.
First Sailor. Treasure on treasure.
Third Sailor. Boxes of precious spice.
First Sailor. Ivory images with amethyst eyes.
Third Sailor. Dragons with eyes of ruby.
First Sailor. The whole ship
Flashes as if it were a net of herrings.
Third Sailor. Let's home; I'd give some rubies to a
woman.
Second Sailor. There's somebody I'd give the amethyst
eyes to.
Aibric [silencing thcm with agesture]. We would return to
our own country, Forgael,
For we have found a treasure that's so great
Imagination cannot reckon it.
And having lit upon this woman there,
What more have you to look for on the seas?
Forgael. I cannot -- I am going on to the end.
As for this woman, I think she is coming with me.
Aibric. The Ever-living have made you mad; but no,
It was this woman in her woman's vengeance
That drove you to it, and I fool enough
To fancy that she'd bring you home again.
'Twas you that egged him to it, for you know
That he is being driven to his death.
Dectora. That is not true, for he has promised me
An unimaginable happiness.
Aibric. And if that happiness be more than dreams,
More than the froth, the feather, the dust-whirl,
The crazy nothing that I think it is,
It shall be in the country of the dead,
If there be such a country.
Dectora. No, not there,
But in some island where the life of the world
Leaps upward, as if all the streams o' the world
Had run into one fountain.
Aibric. Speak to him.
He knows that he is taking you to death;
Speak -- he will not deny it.
Dectora. Is that true?
Forgael. I do not know for certain, but I know.
That I have the best of pilots.
Aibric. Shadows, illusions,
That the Shape-changers, the Ever-laughing Ones,
The Immortal Mockers have cast into his mind,
Or called before his eyes.
Dectora. O carry me
To some sure country, some familia'r place.
Have we not everything that life can give
In having one another?
Forgael. How could I rest
If I refused the messengers and pilots
With all those sights and all that crying out?
Dectora. But I will cover up your eyes and ear?,
That you may never hear the cry of the birds,
Or look upon them.
Forgael. Were they but lowlier
I'd do your will, but they are too high -- too high.
Dectora. Being too high, their heady prophecies
But harry us with hopes that come to nothing,
Because we are not proud, imperishable,
Alone and winged.
Forgael. Our love shall be like theirs
When we have put their changeless image on.
Dectora. I am a woman, I die at every breath.
Aibric. Let the birds scatter, for the tree is broken,
And there's no help in words.  [To the Sailors.]
To the other ship,
And I will follow you and cut the rope
When I have said farewell to this man here,
For neither I nor any living man
Will look upon his face again.
[The Sailors go out.]
Forgael [to Dectora], Go with him,
For he will shelter you and bring you home.
Aibric [taking Forgael's hand]. I'll do it for his sake.
Dectora. No.  Take this sword
And cut the rope, for I go on with Forgael.
Aibric [half falling into the keen]. The yew-bough has been
broken into two,
And all the birds are scattered -- O! O! O!
Farewell! farewell! [He goes out.]
Dectora. The sword is in the rope --
The rope's in two -- it falls into the sea,
It whirls into the foam.  O ancient worm,
Dragon that loved the world and held us to it,
You are broken, you are broken.  The world drifts
away,
And I am left alone with my beloved,
Who cannot put me from his sight for ever.
We are alone for ever, and I laugh,
Forgael, because you cannot put me from you.
The mist has covered the heavens, and you and I
Shall be alone for ever.  We two -- this crown --
I half remember.  It has been in my dreams.
Bend lower, O king, that I may crown you with it.
O flower of the branch, 0 bird among the leaves,
O silver fish that my two hands have taken
Out of the running stream, O morning star
Trembling in the blue heavens like a white fawn
Upon the misty border of the wood,
Bend lower, that I may cover you with my hair,
For we will gaze upon this world no longer.
Forgael [gathering Dectora's hair about him]. Beloved, hav-
ing dragged the net about us,
And knitted mesh to mesh, we grow immortal;
And that old harp awakens of itself
To cry aloud to the grey birds, and dreams,
That have had dreams for father, live in us.

When music is far enough away
the eyelid does not often move
and objects are still as lavender
without breath or distant rejoinder.
The cloud is then so subtly dragged
away by the silver flying machine
that the thought of it alone echoes
unbelievably; the sound of the motor falls
like a coin toward the ocean's floor
and the eye does not flicker
as it does when in the loud sun a coin
rises and nicks the near air. Now,
slowly, the heart breathes to music
while the coins lie in wet yellow sand.

I am offering this poem to you,
since I have nothing else to give.
Keep it like a warm coat,
when winter comes to cover you,
or like a pair of thick socks
the cold cannot bite through,
I love you,
I have nothing else to give you,
so it is a pot full of yellow corn
to warm your belly in the winter,
it is a scarf for your head, to wear
over your hair, to tie up around your face,
I love you,
Keep it, treasure it as you would
if you were lost, needing direction,
in the wilderness life becomes when mature;
and in the corner of your drawer,
tucked away like a cabin or a hogan
in dense trees, come knocking,
and I will answer, give you directions,
and let you warm yourself by this fire,
rest by this fire, and make you feel safe,
I love you,
It's all I have to give,
and it's all anyone needs to live,
and to go on living inside,
when the world outside
no longer cares if you live or die;
remember,
I love you.

There is nothing to be afraid of,
it is only the wind
changing to the east, it is only
your father the thunder
your mother the rain
In this country of water
with its beige moon damp as a mushroom,
its drowned stumps and long birds
that swim, where the moss grows
on all sides of the trees
and your shadow is not your shadow
but your reflection,
your true parents disappear
when the curtain covers your door.
We are the others,
the ones from under the lake
who stand silently beside your bed
with our heads of darkness.
We have come to cover you
with red wool,
with our tears and distant whipers.
You rock in the rain's arms
the chilly ark of your sleep,
while we wait, your night
father and mother
with our cold hands and dead flashlight,
knowing we are only
the wavering shadows thrown
by one candle, in this echo
you will hear twenty years later.

One cannot stay on the summit forever -
One has to come down again.
So why bother in the first place? Just this.
What is above knows what is below -
But what is below does not know what is above
One climb, one sees-
One descends and sees no longer
But one has seen!
There is an art of conducting one's self in
The lower regions by the memory of
What one saw higher up.
When one can no longer see,
One does at least still know.

Hebrew writing and Arabic writing go from east to west,
Latin writing, from west to east.
Languages are like cats:
You must not stroke their hair the wrong way.
The clouds come from the sea, the hot wind from the desert,
The trees bend in the wind,
And stones fly from all four winds,
Into all four winds. They throw stones,
Throw this land, one at the other,
But the land always falls back to the land.
They throw the land, want to get rid of it.
Its stones, its soil, but you can't get rid of it.
They throw stones, throw stones at me
In 1936, 1938, 1948, 1988,
Semites throw at Semites and anti-Semites at anti-Semites,
Evil men throw and just men throw,
Sinners throw and tempters throw,
Geologists throw and theologists throw,
Archaelogists throw and archhooligans throw,
Kidneys throw stones and gall bladders throw,
Head stones and forehead stones and the heart of a stone,
Stones shaped like a screaming mouth
And stones fitting your eyes
Like a pair of glasses,
The past throws stones at the future,
And all of them fall on the present.
Weeping stones and laughing gravel stones,
Even God in the Bible threw stones,
Even the Urim and Tumim were thrown
And got stuck in the beastplate of justice,
And Herod threw stones and what came out was a Temple.
Oh, the poem of stone sadness
Oh, the poem thrown on the stones
Oh, the poem of thrown stones.
Is there in this land
A stone that was never thrown
And never built and never overturned
And never uncovered and never discovered
And never screamed from a wall and never discarded by the builders
And never closed on top of a grave and never lay under lovers
And never turned into a cornerstone?
Please do not throw any more stones,
You are moving the land,
The holy, whole, open land,
You are moving it to the sea
And the sea doesn't want it
The sea says, not in me.
Please throw little stones,
Throw snail fossils, throw gravel,
Justice or injustice from the quarries of Migdal Tsedek,
Throw soft stones, throw sweet clods,
Throw limestone, throw clay,
Throw sand of the seashore,
Throw dust of the desert, throw rust,
Throw soil, throw wind,
Throw air, throw nothing
Until your hands are weary
And the war is weary
And even peace will be weary and will be.
Translated from the Hebrew by Barbara and Benjamin Harshav

There it was, word for word,
The poem that took the place of a mountain.
He breathed its oxygen,
Even when the book lay turned in the dust of his table.
It reminded him how he had needed
A place to go to in his own direction,
How he had recomposed the pines,
Shifted the rocks and picked his way among clouds,
For the outlook that would be right,
Where he would be complete in an unexplained completion:
The exact rock where his inexactness
Would discover, at last, the view toward which they had edged,
Where he could lie and, gazing down at the sea,
Recognize his unique and solitary home.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
this is my first poetry reading
and I’m very nervous
and nearly cancelled tonight
but I spoke about this to
a friend who’s a therapist
and he said,
this is what you do,
you imagine the audience
in front of you
all in their underwear
(as you probably are; but
without the outer layer)
with the men
wearing the most idiotic
flowered Hawaiian
two sizes too large
boxer shorts
and the ladies
in the frumpiest
underwear
you can imagine
apparently it works
so if I look at you, ladies and gentlemen,
somewhat strangely
from time to time
or giggle uncontrollably
or my eyes rest on you personally
as if we’re sharing some huge
x-ray joke,
please forgive me
and understand
that’s it for your benefit
as well as mine
and that you will have put your outerwear
back on
in the interval
before the next poem
I hope this is OK with you
and nobody’s too embarrassed
in fact you could do the same trick
with me if it’s
any help
and now
I think I’ve said enough as
I’m OK now
how about you?
(For maximum effect, pause noticeably at the end of each line)
(with thanks to Ernestine for the idea)

I.
While envious crowds the summit view,
Where Danger with Ambition strays;
Or far, with anxious step, pursue
Pale Av'rice, thro' his winding ways;
The selfish passions in their train,
Whose force the social ties unbind,
And chill the love of human kind,
And make fond Nature's best emotions vain;
II.
O, poesy! O nymph most dear,
To whom I early gave my heart,--
Whose voice is sweetest to my ear
Of aught in nature or in art;
Thou, who canst all my breast controul,
Come, and thy harp of various cadence bring,
And long with melting music swell the string
That suits the present temper of my soul.
III.
O! ever gild my path of woe,
And I the ills of life can bear;
Let but thy lovely visions glow,
And chase the forms of real care;
O still, when tempted to repine
At partial Fortune's frown severe,
Wipe from my eyes the anxious tear,
And whisper that thy soothing joys are mine!
IV.
When did my fancy ever frame
A dream of joy by thee unblest?
When first my lips pronounc'd thy name,
New pleasure warm'd my infant breast.
I lov'd to form the jingling rhyme,
The measur'd sounds, tho' rude, my ear could please,
Could give the little pains of childhood ease,
And long have sooth'd the keener pains of time.
V.
The idle crowd in fashion's train,
Their trifling comment, pert reply,
Who talk so much, yet talk in vain,
How pleas'd for thee, O nymph, I fly!
For thine is all the wealth of mind,
Thine the unborrow'd gems of thought;
The flash of light by souls refin'd,
From heav'n's empyreal source exulting caught.
VI.
And ah! when destin'd to forego
The social hour with those I love,--
That charm which brightens all below,
That joy all other joys above,
And dearer to this breast of mine,
O Muse! than aught thy magic power can give,--
Then on the gloom of lonely sadness shine,
And bid thy airy forms around me live.
VII.
Thy page, O SHAKESPEARE ! let me view,
Thine! at whose name my bosom glows;
Proud that my earliest breath I drew
In that blest isle where SHAKESPEARE rose!
Where shall my dazzled glances roll?
Shall I pursue gay Ariel's flight?
Or wander where those hags of night
With deeds unnam'd shall freeze my trembling soul?
VIII.
Plunge me, foul sisters! in the gloom
Ye wrap around yon blasted heath:
To hear the harrowing rite I come,
That calls the angry shades from death!
Away--my frighted bosom spare!
Let true Cordelia pour her filial sigh,
Let Desdemona lift her pleading eye,
And poor Ophelia sing in wild despair!
IX.
When the bright noon of summer streams
In one wide flash of lavish day,
As soon shall mortal count the beams,
As tell the powers of SHAKESPEARE'S lay!
O, Nature's Poet! the untaught,
The simple mind thy tale pursues,
And wonders by what art it views
The perfect image of each native thought.
X.
In those still moments, when the breast,
Expanded, leaves its cares behind,
Glows by some higher thought possest,
And feels the energies of mind;
Then, awful MILTON , raise the veil
That hides from human eye the heav'nly throng!
Immortal sons of light! I hear your song,
I hear your high-tun'd harps creation hail!
XI
Well might creation claim your care,
And well the string of rapture move,
When all was perfect, good, and fair,
When all was music, joy, and love!
Ere Evil's inauspicious birth
Chang'd Nature's harmony to strife;
And wild Remorse, abhorring life,
And deep Affliction, spread their shade on earth.
XII
Blest Poesy! O, sent to calm
The human pains which all must feel,
Still shed on life thy precious balm,
And every wound of nature heal!
Is there a heart of human frame
Along the burning track of torrid light,
Or 'mid the fearful waste of polar night,
That never glow'd at thy inspiring name?
XIII.
Ye Southern Isles,* emerg'd so late
Where the Pacific billow rolls,
Witness, though rude your simple state,
How heav'n-taught verse can melt your souls!
Say, when you hear the wand'ring bard,
How thrill'd ye listen to his lay,
By what kind arts ye court his stay,--
All savage life affords his sure reward.
XIV.
So, when great HOMER 'S chiefs prepare,
Awhile from War's rude toils releas'd,
The pious hecatomb, and share
The flowing bowl, and genial feast:
Some heav'nly minstrel sweeps the lyre,
While all applaud the poet's native art;
For him they heap the viand's choicest part,
And copious goblets crown the Muse's fire.
XV.
Ev'n here , in scenes of pride and gain,
Where faint each genuine feeling glows;
Here , Nature asks, in want and pain,
The dear illusions verse bestows;
The poor, from hunger, and from cold,
Spare one small coin, the ballad's price,
Admire their poet's quaint device,
And marvel much at all his rhymes unfold.
XVI.
Ye children, lost in forests drear,
Still o'er your wrongs each bosom grieves,
And long the red-breast shall be dear,
Who strew'd each little corpse with leaves;
For you my earliest tears were shed,
For you the gaudy doll I pleas'd forsook,
And heard, with hands uprais'd, and eager look,
The cruel tale, and wish'd ye were not dead!
XVII.
And still on Scotia's northern shore,
"At times, between the rushing blast,"
Recording mem'ry loves to pour
The mournful song of ages past;
Come, lonely Bard "of other years!"
While dim the half-seen moon of varying skies,
While sad the wind along the grey moss sighs,
And give my pensive heart "the joy of tears!"
XVIII.
The various tropes that splendour dart
Around the modern poet's line,
Where, borrow'd from the sphere of art,
Unnumber'd gay allusions shine,
Have not a charm my breast to please
Like the blue mist, the meteor's beam,
The dark-brow'd rock, the mountain stream,
And the light thistle waving in the breeze.
XIX.
Wild Poesy, in haunts sublime,
Delights her lofty note to pour;
She loves the hanging rock to climb,
And hear the sweeping torrent roar!
The little scene of cultur'd grace
But faintly her expanded bosom warms;
She seeks the daring stroke, the awful charms,
Which Nature's pencil throws on Nature's face.
XX.
O, Nature! thou whose works divine
Such rapture in this breast inspire,
As makes me dream one spark is mine
Of Poesy's celestial fire;
When doom'd, "in cities pent," to leave
The kindling morn's unfolding view,
Which ever wears some aspect new,
And all the shadowy forms of soothing eve;
XXI.
Then, THOMSON , then be ever near,
And paint whatever season reigns;
Still let me see the varying year,
And worship Nature in thy strains;
Now, when the wint'ry tempests roll,
Unfold their dark and desolating form,
Rush in the savage madness of the storm,
And spread those horrors that exalt my soul!
XXII.
And, POPE the music of thy verse
Shall winter's dreary gloom dispel,
And fond remembrance oft rehearse
The moral song she knows so well;
The sportive sylphs shall flutter here,--
There Eloise, in anguish pale,
"Kiss with cold lips the sacred veil,
"And drop with every bead too soft a tear!"
XXIII.
When disappointment's sick'ning pain
With chilling sadness numbs my breast,
That feels its dearest hope was vain,
And bids its fruitless struggles rest;
When those for whom I wish to live,
With cold suspicion wrong my aching heart;
Or, doom'd from those for ever lov'd to part,
And feel a sharper pang than death can give;
XXIV.
Then with the mournful Bard I go,
Whom "melancholy mark'd her own,"
While tolls the curfew, solemn, slow,
And wander amid graves unknown;
With yon pale orb, lov'd poet, come!
While from those elms long shadows spread,
And where the lines of light are shed,
Read the fond record of the rustic tomb!
XXV.
Or let me o'er old Conway's flood
Hang on the frowning rock, and trace
The characters that, wove in blood,
Stamp'd the dire fate of EDWARD'S race;
Proud tyrant! tear thy laurell'd plume;
How poor thy vain pretence to deathless fame!
The injur'd Muse records thy lasting shame,
And she has power to "ratify thy doom."
XXVI.
Nature, when first she smiling came,
To wake within the human breast
The sacred Muse's hallow'd flame,
And earth, with heav'n's rich spirit blest!
Nature in that auspicious hour,
With awful mandate, bade the Bard
The register of glory guard,
And gave him o'er all mortal honours power.
XXVII.
Can Fame on Painting's aid rely?
Or lean on Sculpture's trophy'd bust?--
The faithless colours bloom to die,
The crumbling pillar mocks its trust;
But thou, O Muse, immortal maid!
Canst paint the godlike deeds that praise inspire,
Or worth, that lives but in the mind's desire,
In tints that only shall with Nature fade!
XXVIII.
O tell me, partial nymph! what rite,
What incense sweet, what homage true,
Draws from thy fount of purest light
The flame it lends a chosen few?
Alas! these lips can never frame
The mystic vow that moves thy breast;
Yet by thy joys my life is blest,
And my fond soul shall consecrate thy name.

and right now, I’m spending most of my time
on the two matters of which I seem to know the least –
love; and poetry.
maybe it’s good I feel like this; after all,
they’re two pretty big things in their way;
and if it’s frustrating that
I don’t seem to get anywhere,
or understand any more,
maybe that’s good too since
it keeps me at it
and out of harm’s way
as they say
let’s take poetry first – that’s
relatively straightforward:
one day I love the freedom
of the current situation – there’s no rules
except, the lines are short –
but even that, you can break
with ‘prose poems’ (and leave it
to others to say when 'prose poems'
become ‘poetic prose’ etc…) :
tell the unvarnished truth,
tell it like it is; offer all your heart
ungiftwrapped;
then next day I miss the music
of a poem that – with some difficulty –
rhymes and dances in its rhythms,
catches you in its woven spell,
reads as if it wrote itself,
sings its own fair song,
even though of course
the rhyme then makes you deviate
from the theme – but that can take you to
more interesting places in the mind —
so - point of this - I’m none the wiser
about what poetry is; though of course
maybe there’s some benefit I just don’t spot
by kinda mixing thisnthat..
so, when I’m not writing this stuff
that I call poetry, if I call it anything,
I’m addressing the question
of love; in the hope
that thinking about it might just be
of some use; influence action; and
make me more loving; or help me
write poetry about it, ha..
well don’t ask me, not just yet..
though, we all know what love is...
when it’s on our side?
one day, I feel good that I’ve spent the day
reading inspiring words, like,
the whole Creation is one single act
of love; that it brought the whole universe
into manifestation; sustains it; merges all things into love;
that love is knowledge; holds all forms
through law, by law; that law and love
are always together; that love’s
the natural state of ourself; that
every creature has pure love within its nature;
that thus, it’s our very nature
to love one another; love
our neighbour as ourself…
even, love ourselves...
then the next day, I can’t bear
to read any more of what’s written
about love; just spend the day in love
with everything and everyone;
being still a little, listening to music a little,
reading inspiring poetry a little,
going out or not going out,
being just myself a lot; seeing things around
inside the house and out
so vividly, it’s like being high
without the before and after, and
I wonder why it isn’t
always just like this..
then the next day again, I’m just too busy
to give thought to thinking about love,
or being loving to those bloody neighbours
then the doorbell rings – and
I greet whoever it is before
I even look at them, as if
they’re the one person out of all the world
I most wanted to see again right now – and
it’s someone to read the meter –'hallo!
what, again so soon? I’ve only just paid
the last bill, and anyway, it always comes
as ‘estimated’, and too high…'
too late – I’ve loved them totally
in that first moment; I'm like
someone else; I find myself
treating them like an honoured guest;
see them out with a friendly comment; feel good;
a sorta indifferent, unthought, unshaped happiness..
maybe there’s something to be discovered
in all this love thing,
whatever it is.. maybe
I’ll go try to write a poem about it,
see where it goes
[This poem is dedicated to the memory of Bukowski, the poet
who taught us to write it like it is - even if his later work...]

Faithful to your commandments, o consciousness, o
Holy bird of words soaring ever whether to nothingness or
to inconceivable fulfillment slowly:
And still I follow you, awkward as that dandy of ontology
and as awkward as his albatross and as
another dandy of ontology before him, another shepherd
and watchdog of being, the one who
Talked forever of forever as if forever of having been
and being an ancient mariner,
Hesitant forever as if forever were the albatross
Hung round his neck by the seven seas of the seven muses,
and with as little conclusion, since being never concludes,
Studying the sibilance and the splashing of the seas and of
seeing and of being's infinite seas,
Staring at the ever-blue and the far small stars and
the faint white endless curtain of the
twinkling play's endless seasons.

why poetry?
to realise that
a simple smile
can mean so
many things
and interpreted
in so many ways
that there is
always a fresh way
to look at things
the way god
has been able
to give each of us
a new way to
experience  things
a cross puzzle
he  challenges us
to find the uniqueness
he  has meant for
all of us to be
languages, geographies
genes, religions
universes, angels...
every facet that helps
a diamond to sparkle
its own way

it
takes
a lot of
desperation
dissatisfaction
and
di sillusion
to
write
a
few
good
p oems.
it's not
for
everybody
either to
write
it
or even to
read
it

Reiterative poetry it seems proper to say
Has seen little sunlight in present day.
Yet it represents in all regard,
The beginning as English language broached forward.
Base on Anglo Saxon and Anglo Norman tongues
Reiterative poetry sloughed reluctantly along
Combining words in ways most proper
And in some case, crudely brought to halt, a stopper.
Meanings lost or lesser known,
Words and spellings made to fit the event reported on.
Such it is that Piers Plowman was written
By William Langland and others(?)  too, in 1462.
Reiterative simply means repeat sounds; words or their beginnings
To occur at least twice in each line's soundings.
Thought to be borne on the method of basic speech
Slow and deliberate as the speaker sought to teach.
Imagine if you will the illusion the teller
Wished to instill in the entranced listener,
Pausing for effect on each word of the reiterative pair,
For emphasis that would be embedded there.
The Vision that Will viewed from his slumbers,
Was perhaps a dream of dreary numbers.
Cascading before his closed eyes,
Were temptations in their disguises.
Along the way the visions, as you will
Enticed the reader to revel,
In tales of harlots and their heady stews
Where pleasure was sought (and found)  in their due.
The Church of Rome was ragged about in play,
With fat priest in habits placed on display
Their custom of taking what they may
From the serfs and sundry workers of the day.
Then there is the use of ‘fables' to instruct,
As example, 'Belling the Cat' is one of such.
The moral of the story is two fold and more,
As the men are told they cannot be as independent mice of lore.
But should bear allegiance to the King (the cat)
Who protects, administers and all that,
Taking only 'a little' from each one
So that they can live their life in freedom.
As example, seen in France, the death of the cat
Only brings on horrors (and yet another cat) .
Langland never was quite pleased with his poem
And rewrote it several times and some.
Sometimes using reiterative style
To make his point, but when the method failed
Used free verse to get the story told
That's the way it was in days of old.
So it is related with this Reiterative Poem
Hoping to provide humble examples to some,
Who might wish to try their hand
Writing poetry, as the method properly demands.

I read the headline slowly, a second time,
Just to be sure:
“Aspiring Poet Drowns in Hudson Trying to Save Poems”
It seems a young body threw itself into the river
Chasing its paper heart and soul
As they sank to the black bottom below
Held hostage in a backpack.
Seems even the lightweight models
Aren’t quite light
Enough.
Someone should have told him,
Warned him of the truth:
Poetry is in the writing, not on the paper.
Paper words merely mimic the mind,
Cheaper by the dozen
One thousandth of a picture.
Sometimes you get a “hmmm” and a wink
From a reader in Des Moines,
And frankly, that should suffice.
By all means, share your thoughts.
Mind and body are for the taking
And the giving.
But for God’s sake guard your heart and soul,
Back them up from time to time,
For when these are left lying around carelessly,
It’s bound to end badly
Sooner or later.

Neither straight, nor curved,
The longest line
On Earth!

One way to be very happy is to be very rich
For then you can buy orchids by the quire and bacon by the flitch.
And yet at the same time People don't mind if you only tip them a dime,
Because it's very funny
But somehow if you're rich enough you can get away with spending
water like money
While if you're not rich you can spend in one evening your salary for
the year
And everybody will just stand around and jeer.
If you are rich you don't have to think twice about buying a judge or a
horse,
Or a lower instead of an upper, or a new suit, or a divorce,
And you never have to say When,
And you can sleep every morning until nine or ten,
All of which
Explains why I should like very, very much to be very, very rich.

Poverty and misrule
Wolves are same all over
You need to think it over
Liberty and freedom
Go together seldom
Under the same name
People gang up to come
In power and try to rule
Rest all people watch them as fool
Poor shall suffer more
As restrictions shall not be over
Their freedom of expression shall remain on paper
They will remain free but facing starvation and hunger
Africa has natural sources in abundance
Now you have got chance
Rise above pretty considerations
And exert pressure as an independent nation
If no resistance is offered
Or awareness is created
You shall be kept under control
To face poverty and misrule

Mom and dad depressed.
Children's bellies extended.
This is poverty.
We laugh and play games
eat macaroni and cheese.
We don't know we're poor.

I am a proud man
Not because of my wealth
But for my poverty which provides me
Lots of ideas and thoughts
And helps me to delve into my life
To fetch out some rich philosophies
And break into a way to lead a   life, contended
Without those banal luxury
Moreover I am trilled to think
That in life love and peace
Never dependent on materials
If they are in abundance or in scarcity.

There's smoke in the air
I walk stupefied;
For, I just witnessed a horrendous sight.
A thin, weakling child, clinging to an equally young mother.
I wonder at God's justice,
To the well-fed, he does not give children and to this beggarly girl (I couldn't muster strength enough to call her a woman) a child at such a young age!
Why O God! this disparity?
To one who cannot feed; a child at such a young age, and to those who can give all the joys of this world,
No children.

POVERTY: WAR OF TODAY
melvin banggollay
Poverty abound everywhere
Even in paradise of plenty
As long as there are brothers
Who seldom eat sweet honey,
as long as there are sisters
under prostitution's malady,
when  children are still under
abuse and exploitation by many
and as long as there are disaster
jeopardizing life and property.
Poverty is a  war and disaster
Hounting every nation today
that can't be won by a leader
without the help of everybody
as it is a war arm with disaster
that can only be hurdled with unity,
frugality, thriftiness with power,
economical spending and industry,
good governance by our leaders
with an undying vow to foster unity
peace and cooperation as brothers
among anyone to preserve humanity.

I met her on the Umbrian hills,
Her hair unbound, her feet unshod:
As one whom secret glory fills
She walked, alone with God.
I met her in the city street:
Oh, changed was all her aspect then!
With heavy eyes and weary feet
She walked alone, with men.

I am beyond the help of prayer...I am in the abyss of a double life
One which I brought upon myself and another Fate has dealt me
I was preyed upon and cast into the belly of the Beast
Its lies and deceit washed me in a digestive saliva
Breaking down all of my defenses and leaving me ready
To become nothing more than excrement...
Prayers can't help that kind of shit....
(2007)

U Fooled me
U Cheated on me
U let me go
U made me cry
U forced me to believe your lies
U tried to control me
U betrayed me
U did not love me
U never knew me
U never understood me
even you have never ever  tried
Finally, simply u left me
But now all I can say is
I love you
because this is something I have no power upon to
and I just cannot stop thinking about you
because this is not something I usually do

Power can tackle power,
Power can go deep in to the air.
And in the air, we find only fire.
Fire is there to inspire,
Air is there to take care.

A Word is capable of anything
It is capable of changing enemies
into friends.
It is capable of penetrating
the impenetrable.
It is capable of changing the impossibility
into possibilities.
It is capable of uniting man and woman into
husband and wife.
It is capable of changing the Atheist into
Christian.
It is capable of changing illiterate into
professional.
It is capable of changing political crisis into
independence.
Beginning today let us not just utter words
but live by them, let your words be sweet and
caring to  all those around you.
Because we never know how far reaching
something we may think, say or do today
will affect the lives of millions tomorrow.

Where the world goes
Where the power goes
Power the great power
Makes the powered arrogant.
Power can make wonders
Ruling power so mighty
Where people are subjects
Submissive they try to achieve
Humans challenges the power
Absolute power of autocracy
Opts for people's power
where people's will triumphs
Emperors lost, kingdoms gone
Collective will beautiful ever
Collective power always nice
Power the great power
World goes with power and problems.

To have the right to dream
and to follow it each day
until some tiny part of it
is you in every way
gives zest to all of living
and lets you dream some more
'til at last you are near heaven's gate
as your thoughts lift up and soar.
This, then, the freedom that I seek
for you and all mankind
the spark of real achievement
capturing heart and soul and mind.
To strike off lingering chains of doubt
look out on a new day
where freedom holds you to a task
that asks your best in every way.

Cruel friend
Trust built on lies
Holding on to the wound
That will never heal
Beyond repair
Upon the betrayal of a friend.
I only have the strength
For one last word;
Good-bye
Good-bye to sleepless nights
Helplessness in your arms
To a lifetime of your dreams
Power of your screams
There is no strength left in me to fight
Pick your battles
Because you already lost this one
How can I be your friend?
When all that’s left is the strength to say
Good-bye.

It was a special time indeed, when Christ chose to died upon a tree,
For He didn't die because of a crime, but He died for you and me.
On the morning before He died, as the garden was quiet and still,
He chose to do a work of Love and follow His Father's will.
He told the Disciples to wait and watch as he went away to pray,
But when He returned, He found them all asleep, much to His dismay.
He then went back to pray to The Father, not once but two more times,
Although He wanted the cup to pass he said Father your will not mine.
Filled with anguish He continued to pray to The One in whom He loved,
In so much pain as He prayed, His sweat fell to the ground like blood.
When He returned to the disciples, it was no surprise to The Lord,
As they saw Judas leading a crowd, with each man lifting a sword.
He was arrested that day, for you and I, and lead off to face a trial
While the Apostle who said that he never would, went into denial.
In their grief instead of holding fast to the Only One that mattered,
As The Scriptures clearly stated, the rest of the disciples scattered.
After they regathered, but filled with grief, much to their surprise,
As it was clearly taught by the prophets, The Lord truly did arise.
And as they understood that day, Christ's Resurrection set them free,
Today that same power is available to you, if you only would believe.

From them only negative stuff we do hear
They tell us who to trust and tell us who to fear
We want to believe the lies to us they tell
They promise Utopia and give us Earthly Hell.
We want to believe every word that they say
And for to cling to power they create us and they
We help to create our own reality
The blind in the light of day never do see.
Their pre election promises they never do keep
We give them our power and we follow like sheep
They tell us who to fear and them we believe
And they laugh behind our backs and us they deceive.
Through false patriotism to power they do cling
And the praises of war heroes they gladly do sing
They cling on to power and they cheat and they lie
Whilst in the wars they created the innocents die.

We all must bring our
Racism to end.
A message to all, I long to send.
The colors of the world,
All join as one.
For the Lord is our shepherd,
And we as his son.
Christ made all man in the
Likes of him.
So please let us all, "End Racism".

I saw its ugly head
And witnessed its action.
I saw the color of its forehead
And the mental degradation
That it can cause.
No need to pause,
I saw the size of its teeth.
This beast moves like a serpent.
At times behaves like a thief,
Who's not afraid to rant.
I saw the elephant in the room.
This is scary; let me get the broom,
To chase it, let me get something,
So I can expel it from the ring.
I saw the sad smile of racism,
It is sneaky like a sick possum,
Who wants to hide the body in the drum.
I am warning you that it is worse than a cancer.
It can poison the children of Mother Nature.
I saw the stand-up reptile, the grand wizard,
The archaic ginormous lizard.
I've survived to see its ugly head
And to witness its action and inaction
I saw the color of its forehead
And its indiscriminate destruction.
I saw the penguins doing the moonwalk,
They gestured and also attempted to talk.

I always feel disappointed when of racism I read
And when I read of it in Ireland I feel very sad indeed
For racism in society should never have a place
And people should never be judged on their colour or their race.
As the Land of saints and scholars Ireland was known Worldwide
And the Irish people suffered and their rights to them denied
But the Irish in their sense of fair play could take a certain pride
And for their human rights and liberty the sons of Ireland died.
Poor migrants from Romania their possessions weigh light
To live and work in Ireland do they not have the right?
They may come un-invited but their numbers only small
And the Irish too are migrants as history will recall.
I read it's the Irish media that fans racism's flame
If this be so of their bad work they must feel a great shame
They cannot say in years to come the fault was never ours
When they first used the noxious spray that poisoned all the flowers.
I am an Irish migrant far from my native shore
And others treat me with respect than that one could not ask for more
A fair go for all people and for everyone fair play
Those words from centuries ago are relevant today.

some people
lick racism like
an ice cream

Racism is still alive
They just be concealing it
Inequality is still prevalent
Systematic efforts
Can’t conceal its relevance
Injustice is rife
Even the blind can see it
Racism never died
Society was fed
Multicultural lies
Some speak out against it
Only when it’s politically convenient
But political correctness can’t mask
Society’s underlying institutionally racist elements
Racial profiling, discrimination, xenophobia & stereotypes
Live in the mindsets
Of men & women
Even some children
Can’t see past pigmentation
Racism is still alive
And well
Just ask those discriminated against on a daily basis
Because their skin color
Will always be different.

black holocaust hell
racial hate
venom born of fate

We the black people,
The workin folk
Bus drivers, waiters, garbage men
The common peeps dat
The millionaires and billionaires
Regard as a pathic joke
Our lives to them
A pig in a poke
When we cry foul
They act as if
Nobody speaks,
This planned but never implemented
Democratic process reeks
Our so called government
IS Full of pie-backed, two faced
Money hungry anglo freaks
With new world order
Tattooed on their cheeks
Cause most of us
Have took a toke
Of weed or alcohol or coke
Got high…
And are victims of the
Propaganda laced media…..
In a stupor we ask why…
Why do they lie…?
To the poor and disenfranchised
That still clings to the concept
Of baseball and apple pie
Of God and country

We the black people
Hope
That all these racist

That all these nazi, .. Skin head

Death is honey
Twisted honkeys, ... fry, .. TODAY…Listen to what I say

How long will the hooligans,
Vandalizers,
Looters,

And thugs
Will keep
Engaging the stage
Of racism,
Anti-racism,
Protest,
Protest drama,

Goondaism,
This goondaism must
Come to an end
As has gone into excess
And excess of everything
Is bad?

Racism finds no home
in the heart
of an enlightened soul.
Many proclaim their faith
but few live their faith with every breathe breathed
to the core of their being
to depths
of not a judgemental;
but a compassionate soul.

Rain-days are funny
Funnier, rain-nights
The sky assumes
All grey, black and purple
Streaks of lightning
Brighten the sky's
Dark chambers...
As it rains outside
As rain alone pleases,
An hitherto unknown warmth
Spreads through my body.
I rush outside to cool myself
And lo, rain stops
As rain alone can, abruptly,
Callous to the burning insides
To settle for themselves
Rain-days are temperamental
Rain-nights, lonely and desolate...
(05 Aug 2011)

THEY sing their dearest songs--
He, she, all of them--yea,
Treble and tenor and bass.
And one to play;
With the candles mooning each face....
Ah, no; the years O!
How the sick leaves reel down in throngs!
They clear the creeping moss--
Elders and juniors--aye,
Making the pathways neat
And the garden gay;
And they build a shady seat....
Ah, no; the years, the years;
See, the white storm-birds wing across!
They are blithely breakfasting all--
Men and maidens--yea,
Under the summer tree,
With a glimpse of the bay,
While pet fowl come to the knee....
Ah, no; the years O!
And the rotten rose is ripped from the wall.
They change to a high new house,
He, she, all of them--aye,
Clocks and carpets and chairs
On the lawn all day,
And brightest things that are theirs....
Ah, no; the years, the years;
Down their carved names the raindrop plows.

Like the touch of rain she was
On a man's flesh and hair and eyes
When the joy of walking thus
Has taken him by surprise:
With the love of the storm he burns,
He sings, he laughs, well I know how,
But forgets when he returns
As I shall not forget her 'Go now'.
Those two words shut a door
Between me and the blessed rain
That was never shut before
And will not open again.

Comes from the dark cloud
That makes a noise loud
Rain, cold rain
Tinkles so softly
Like a slow moving train
Rain, happy rain
Enriched the dry land
With many a soft hand
Rain, shining rain
Like the clumps of water pearls
That comes again and again
Rain, heavy rain
Relieving the overpowering heat
Whether a hill or a plain
Rain, dumping rain
Filling the street with water
Turning it into the overflowing drain
Rain, drizzling rain
Making the children cheerful
Forgetting all their pain

Sitting in the rain as it falls on my face,
Thinking about making love is a wondrous place.
As the rain falls down my chest,
To the place that you know best.
As the rain gets harder your strokes get
stronger,
Going deeper and deeper making the process longer.
Running your fingers through
my wet hair,
Sucking my breast as you
take me there.
As my moans get louder the
rain drowns me out,
It feels so good showing me
what your man hoods about.
As the rain keep coming so do
I,
Hitting it right as you give me
that natural high.
As the ran role down my check
so do a tear,
As you sexually take away my
fears.
As your lips touch mine so do
the rain,
Holding me tight giving me that
passionate pain.
As the rain slows down I
don’t want it to stop,
The rain is cool, but my
body is hot.
As the rain stop and the love
making finally ends,
I hope tomorrows forecast
say rain so we can do this again.

Rain on tinned roof
Rain on concrete
Rain soaking into sands
Rain on soft earth
Rain on metal road
Rain on windscreen
Rain falling into the sea
Rain in the river
Rain on flowers
Rain on leaves
Rain under trees
Rain on hills
Rain on my skin…
Each with its own unique raga
Reverberates across the sky
On to the earth…

You ever had seen summer rain.
It comes like a wild reflection.
It goes like a bird fly away in a yawning sky.
I don’t want to let it go away.
Cause this is the most gorgeous rain I ever seen.
It keeps some memory inside of me.
Love strike like a rain drops in my heart.
I feel you in each raindrop.
It covers my face like a star casing the sky.
You ever had seen summer rain.
Sense the whisper of the rain.
So I can feel you in the summer rain.
I want to hold that thought.
It makes me passionate about you.
And it makes you smile like a cupid.
Come along with me now.
I want to enjoy this baffling rain.
That’s why I ask you?
You ever had seen summer rain.

Rain on the green grass,
And rain on the tree,
And rain on the house top,
But not on me!

call it the greenhouse effect or whatever
but it just doesn't rain like it used to.
I particularly remember the rains of the
depression era.
there wasn't any money but there was
plenty of rain.
it wouldn't rain for just a night or
a day,
it would RAIN for 7 days and 7
nights
and in Los Angeles the storm drains
weren't built to carry off taht much
water
and the rain came down THICK and
MEAN and
STEADY
and you HEARD it banging against
the roofs and into the ground
waterfalls of it came down
from roofs
and there was HAIL
big ROCKS OF ICE
bombing
exploding smashing into things
and the rain
just wouldn't
STOP
and all the roofs leaked-
dishpans,
cooking pots
were placed all about;
they dripped loudly
and had to be emptied
again and
again.
the rain came up over the street curbings,
across the lawns, climbed up the steps and
entered the houses.
there were mops and bathroom towels,
and the rain often came up through the
toilets:bubbling, brown, crazy,whirling,
and all the old cars stood in the streets,
cars that had problems starting on a
sunny day,
and the jobless men stood
looking out the windows
at the old machines dying
like living things out there.
the jobless men,
failures in a failing time
were imprisoned in their houses with their
wives and children
and their
pets.
the pets refused to go out
and left their waste in
strange places.
the jobless men went mad
confined with
their once beautiful wives.
there were terrible arguments
as notices of foreclosure
fell into the mailbox.
rain and hail, cans of beans,
bread without butter; fried
eggs, boiled eggs, poached
eggs; peanut butter
sandwiches, and an invisible
chicken in every pot.
my father, never a good man
at best, beat my mother
when it rained
as I threw myself
between them,
the legs, the knees, the
screams
until they
seperated.
'I'll kill you,' I screamed
at him. 'You hit her again
and I'll kill you! '
'Get that son-of-a-bitching
kid out of here! '
'no, Henry, you stay with
your mother! '
all the households were under
seige but I believe that ours
held more terror than the
average.
and at night
as we attempted to sleep
the rains still came down
and it was in bed
in the dark
watching the moon against
the scarred window
so bravely
holding out
most of the rain,
I thought of Noah and the
Ark
and I thought, it has come
again.
we all thought
that.
and then, at once, it would
stop.
and it always seemed to
stop
around 5 or 6 a.m.,
peaceful then,
but not an exact silence
because things continued to
drip
drip
drip
and there was no smog then
and by 8 a.m.
there was a
blazing yellow sunlight,
Van Gogh yellow-
crazy, blinding!
and then
the roof drains
relieved of the rush of
water
began to expand in the warmth:
PANG! PANG! PANG!
and everybody got up and looked outside
and there were all the lawns
still soaked
greener than green will ever
be
and there were birds
on the lawn
CHIRPING like mad,
they hadn't eaten decently
for 7 days and 7 nights
and they were weary of
berries
and
they waited as the worms
rose to the top,
half drowned worms.
the birds plucked them
up
and gobbled them
down; there were
blackbirds and sparrows.
the blackbirds tried to
drive the sparrows off
but the sparrows,
maddened with hunger,
smaller and quicker,
got their
due.
the men stood on their porches
smoking cigarettes,
now knowing
they'd have to go out
there
to look for that job
that probably wasn't
there, to start that car
that probably wouldn't
start.
and the once beautiful
wives
stood in their bathrooms
combing their hair,
applying makeup,
trying to put their world back
together again,
trying to forget that
awful sadness that
gripped them,
wondering what they could
fix for
breakfast.
and on the radio
we were told that
school was now
open.
and
soon
there I was
on the way to school,
massive puddles in the
street,
the sun like a new
world,
my parents back in that
house,
I arrived at my classroom
on time.
Mrs. Sorenson greeted us
with, 'we won't have our
usual recess, the grounds
are too wet.'
'AW! ' most of the boys
went.
'but we are going to do
something special at
recess,' she went on,
'and it will be
fun! '
well, we all wondered
what that would
be
and the two hour wait
seemed a long time
as Mrs.Sorenson
went about
teaching her
lessons.
I looked at the little
girls, they looked so
pretty and clean and
alert,
they sat still and
straight
and their hair was
beautiful
in the California
sunshine.
the the recess bells rang
and we all waited for the
fun.
then Mrs. Sorenson told us:
'now, what we are going to
do is we are going to tell
each other what we did
during the rainstorm!
we'll begin in the front row
and go right around!
now, Michael, you're first! ...'
well, we all began to tell
our stories, Michael began
and it went on and on,
and soon we realized that
we were all lying, not
exactly lying but mostly
lying and some of the boys
began to snicker and some
of the girls began to give
them dirty looks and
Mrs.Sorenson said,
'all right! I demand a
modicum of silence
here!
I am interested in what
you did
during the rainstorm
even if you
aren't! '
so we had to tell our
stories and they were
stories.
one girl said that
when the rainbow first
came
she saw God's face
at the end of it.
only she didn't say which end.
one boy said he stuck
his fishing pole
out the window
and caught a little
fish
and fed it to his
cat.
almost everybody told
a lie.
the truth was just
too awful and
embarassing to tell.
then the bell rang
and recess was
over.
'thank you,' said Mrs.
Sorenson, 'that was very
nice.
and tomorrow the grounds
will be dry
and we will put them
to use
again.'
most of the boys
cheered
and the little girls
sat very straight and
still,
looking so pretty and
clean and
alert,
their hair beautiful in a sunshine that
the world might never see
again.
and

A Rainbow is…
An undeniable natural beauty,
Appearing mysteriously,
Seven colors of grandeur rare.
Light touching droplets in the air,
From earthly showers or water spray,
Opposite the sun, observed at day.
Arrayed in brilliant colors glow,
Canvassed as a beauty bow;
Red, orange, yellow, green,
indigo, blue, violet, all are seen.
A sign of God's mercy we know,
Since earth beheld the first Rainbow.
Rainbows are
Amazingly
Indescribable!
Naturally
Beautiful!
Observably
Wonderful!
Not reproducible by mortal man,
Created by our Maker's hands;
As breathlessly we stare,
A masterpiece, none can compare.
More than treasured pots of gold,
All this and more in the Rainbow.
© Loyd C. Taylor

At the end of the rainbow in fable 'tis told
The Leprechaun he hides his bronze pot of gold
And if you should catch him hold on to him tight
Or he will quickly disappear out of your sight
If he escapes from you him you may never see again
Whilst firmly in your grasp your eyes on him must remain
Until his hidden fortune to you he will show
Hold on to him tightly do not leave him go,
He will say I will show you where my gold is hidden if you first set me free
But if you do that out of sight he will flee
Then his pot of gold on your own you won't find
In such an instance one has to be cruel to be kind
But 'twould seem 'tis only a mythological story that has often been told
That at rainbow's end the Leprechaun hides his pot of gold.

Gloomy rainbow...
Oh how the pain doesn't seize to grow...
Watching the days go by...
All I want to do is cry...
I let our love go...
even though I loved you so...
The days go slower everytime I'm reminded of you....
and all the things we used to do...
I plead to you to take me back...
But you say no because of my brutal attack...
That I had to your heart....
And it tore us appart....
I know I was a fool...
He made me think he was cool...
But now I know...
I love you so....
Please take me back to you...
and I hope my love shines through to you...
Looking now to the sky...
I wish I could forever die...
Unlike my love forever grows....
Oh what gloomy rainbows...

my rainbow has changed
for it has faded
for now it just many shades of grey
some darker
some lighter
so worse that others
for I shut down my emotions yesterday
so that those who hurt be would not see me cry
but now I can not seem to turn them on again
it is as if my emotions are lost
all expect for pain
the pain never went away
that I can hide
bury within
but where have all the colors gone
will it ever return
so will I stay in a state of gray
for it is  no longer a rainbow
but a grey scale

Amazing lady you..
like  you has never been..
like him has never seen..
and no one will know,
At night at the sea..
when there you will be..
in the wind you and who,
you will dance with the wind
when the start never end
with the waves both flow,
dropp me back to the rain
keep with you the Love's chain
then back me to the bow,
the amazing one are you...
water me and the buds.
teach the buds how to grow,
Your words like the touch,
your touch like the dew,
Keep on singing every day
toward you open the way
then the feeling let it glow,
keep on raising rate of beats
then the raising keep slow..
BROKEN HEARTS I TREAT..
n your breathing let me live
let me come, let me go..
let the sadness..me  to blow,
how the chance became dance..
how the arts of the parts
let me see and you show..
God CREATION God draw,
words from the heart
from the feeling i will sew..
....................................
The wondrous one are you.......

Raindrops sparkle any day
Look up the sky for a ray
You may find a rainbow
Enjoy the pleasant Nature's color show
First is Robust Red
Put some jam on your bread
Second is Opulent Orange
Time to have a glass of Tangy orange
Third is Yearning Yellow
Place your books in a row
Fourth is Gracious Green
It comes exactly in-between
Ask your friend 'how have you been? '
Fifth is Beautiful Blue
See  the vast sky hue
Sixth is Ingenious Indigo
Say 'See Ya' before you go
Seventh and last is Vibrant Voilet
Thank God! we didn't get wet
If you don't find a rainbow, don't be sad
Wear a smile, we all will be glad!

She was like a rainbow
A delight after a storm
Shimmering so elegantly
And vibrant against the backdrop of sky
Everyone gazing towards her magnificence
Delightful and dazzling like a summer bloom
But alas, gone too soon
For the arc of the rainbow
It slowly fades into the blue
Leaving us saddened, numb in the gloom.
She was like a rainbow
She shone so wonderfully, then
Faded and left us all behind.
Olivia, she will never be forgot.

somewhere
in the sky
on a moist day
you may spy
a rainbow
hanging high
let that always
remind you
one shining
moment true
friendship's
promise renew
`

I love the rainbow with its shades of green and blue,
I love the way the rainbow tells itself to you.
I love the way the rainbow lights up a sunny sky,
I love the way the rainbow tells of truths that are a lie.
I love the rainbow with its every brightly coloured shade,
I love the way the rainbow lights up a sunny day.

Across the red sky two birds flying,
Flying with drooping wings.
Silent and solitary their ominous flight.
All day the triumphant sun with yellow banners
Warred and warred with the earth, and when she yielded
Stabbed her heart, gathered her blood in a chalice,
Spilling it over the evening sky.
When the dark plumaged birds go flying, flying,
Quiet lies the earth wrapt in her mournful shadow,
Her sightless eyes turned to the red sky
And the restlessly seeking birds.

When the king of Egypt,
Let the Israelites go,
God led them not straight
But a roundabout route thro'.
There was a short-cut road;
Yet, a circular way, God preferred,
As in the event of any fight,
They couldn't return to Egypt.
To keep them safe and alert,
He led them thro' the desert,
Trekking o'er the sand,
Towards the Red Sea end.
They were armed for battle,
Ready to fight tooth and nail.
They were very bold this time,
As the Lord was with them.
Joseph's body was in Egypt.
To fulfill his last request,
That his body be taken out,
Moses, with him, brought it.
During the day, as cloud,
God, in front, He led.
Likewise, He went as light,
And led them at night.
Thus, they travelled night and day,
Thro' the God-chosen pathway.
They reached the desert end,
And at Etham, they camped.
What was the picture in Egypt?
The king went in regret
For losing all the slaves,
Who served him for many years.
He took his armed forces
And pursued the Israelites.
He was nearing the camp-site,
With his army ready to fight.
To Moses, the Israelites said,
'Your advice, should we've heard?
Look, what you've done?
Didn't we tell this'll happen? '
'We preferred Egypt's graves,
And remain there as slaves,
Than die here in the desert,
And be thrown in wind and dust.'
Moses assured and said,
'Listen, don't be afraid.
Now, God is on our side.
See the miracle of the Lord.'
To Moses God said,
'Let the people go forward.
Take your stick and lift it.
O'er the sea, you hold it.'
What God said, Moses did.
The sea-water got divided.
They walked on dry ground
Thro' the path, newly found.
Till the last man had crossed,
And other side, they reached,
The sea-ground was open
And God's miracle was on.
With a wave of his stick,
Moses reversed the trick,
When the sea-water closed,
All the enemies were trapped.
The power of the Lord,
The Israelites then realized.
They developed faith in God
And in Moses, the servant of God.
At last, the Egyptians,
Learnt a bitter lesson,
And they had virtually seen,
What God's power had been

Double red daisies, they’re my flowers,
Which nobody else may grow.
In a big quarrelsome house like ours
They try it sometimes—but no,
I root them up because they’re my flowers,
Which nobody else may grow.
Claire has a tea-rose, but she didn’t plant it;
Ben has an iris, but I don’t want it.
Daisies, double red daisies for me,
The beautifulest flowers in the garden.
Double red daisy, that’s my mark:
I paint it in all my books!
It’s carved high up on the beech-tree bark,
How neat and lovely it looks!
So don’t forget that it’s my trade mark;
Don’t copy it in your books.
Claire has a tea-rose, but she didn’t plant it;
Ben has an iris, but I don’t want it.
Daisies, double red daisies for me,
The beautifulest flowers in the garden.

MF: your initials hit me
striking hard - blinding
RosesAreRed - that they are
not all roses are red and
not all things red are roses
MF roses are MF red....
not if you're colour blind
not if you're shot in the head
RosesAreRed - yellow or white
screaming loud - deafening.

Red flags the reason for pretty flags.
And ribbons.
Ribbons of flags
And wearing material
Reason for wearing material.
Give pleasure.
Can you give me the regions.
The regions and the land.
The regions and wheels.
All wheels are perfect.
Enthusiasm.

The beauty of this lovely garden,
The beauty of this lonely rose,
Red, Red Rose!
Heart's love,
My joy.
Heart, art!
Love and art,
This lovely garden,
This lonely rose,
Red, Red Rose!

What was the blackest sight to me
Of all that campaign?
A naked woman tied to a tree
With jagged holes where her breasts should be,
Rotting there in the rain.
On we pressed to the battle fray,
Dogged and dour and spent.
Sudden I heard my Captain say:
"Voilà! Kultur has passed this way,
And left us a monument."
So I looked and I saw our Colonel there,
And his grand head, snowed with the years,
Unto the beat of the rain was bare;
And, oh, there was grief in his frozen stare,
And his cheeks were stung with tears!
Then at last he turned from the woeful tree,
And his face like stone was set;
"Go, march the Regiment past," said he,
"That every father and son may see,
And none may ever forget."
Oh, the crimson strands of her hair downpoured
Over her breasts of woe;
And our grim old Colonel leaned on his sword,
And the men filed past with their rifles lowered,
Solemn and sad and slow.
But I'll never forget till the day I die,
As I stood in the driving rain,
And the jaded columns of men slouched by,
How amazement leapt into every eye,
Then fury and grief and pain.
And some would like madmen stand aghast,
With their hands upclenched to the sky;
And some would cross themselves as they passed,
And some would curse in a scalding blast,
And some like children cry.
Yea, some would be sobbing, and some would pray,
And some hurl hateful names;
But the best had never a word to say;
They turned their twitching faces away,
And their eyes were like hot flames.
They passed; then down on his bended knee
The Colonel dropped to the Dead:
"Poor martyred daughter of France!" said he,
"O dearly, dearly avenged you'll be
Or ever a day be sped!"
Now they hold that we are the best of the best,
And each of our men may wear,
Like a gash of crimson across his chest,
As one fierce-proved in the battle-test,
The blood-red Fourragere.
For each as he leaps to the top can see,
Like an etching of blood on his brain,
A wife or a mother lashed to a tree,
With two black holes where her breasts should be,
Left to rot in the rain.
So we fight like fiends, and of us they say
That we neither yield nor spare.
Oh, we have the bitterest debt to pay. . . .
Have we paid it? -- Look -- how we wear to-day
Like a trophy, gallant and proud and gay,
Our blood-red Fourragere.

Sudden as a mirror, the red house
jumped from behind fluffed trees;
windowed four-square and flat slated
violet as final clouds, it seemed,
(or was, so solid its broad gesture) ,
a brick god chapped with litanies.
And there I was born, not I, but rather
the name of my face, the learned, caught
habits of sufference;  below
the slope of the narrow roof were formed
the tribal totems that hard words
have since tabooed, evaded, sought.
Come on it suddenly as a mirror
there at the road's turn, it was so
locked and fenced that, a blank neighbour
caught in an intimacy he knows
outside his role, I watched a boy
at last turn on his heel and go.

He is said to have been the last Red man
In Action. And the Miller is said to have laughed--
If you like to call such a sound a laugh.
But he gave no one else a laugher's license.
For he turned suddenly grave as if to say,
'Whose business,--if I take it on myself,
Whose business--but why talk round the barn?--
When it's just that I hold with getting a thing done with.'
You can't get back and see it as he saw it.
It's too long a story to go into now.
You'd have to have been there and lived it.
They you wouldn't have looked on it as just a matter
Of who began it between the two races.
Some guttural exclamation of surprise
The Red man gave in poking about the mill
Over the great big thumping shuffling millstone
Disgusted the Miller physically as coming
From one who had no right to be heard from.
'Come, John,' he said, 'you want to see the wheel-pint?'
He took him down below a cramping rafter,
And showed him, through a manhole in the floor,
The water in desperate straits like frantic fish,
Salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails.
The he shut down the trap door with a ring in it
That jangled even above the general noise,
And came upstairs alone--and gave that laugh,
And said something to a man with a meal-sack
That the man with the meal-sack didn't catch--then.
Oh, yes, he showed John the wheel-pit all right.

we had goldfish and they circled around and around
in the bowl on the table near the heavy drapes
covering the picture window and
my mother, always smiling, wanting us all
to be happy, told me, 'be happy Henry!'
and she was right: it's better to be happy if you
can
but my father continued to beat her and me several times a week while
raging inside his 6-foot-two frame because he couldn't
understand what was attacking him from within.
my mother, poor fish,
wanting to be happy, beaten two or three times a
week, telling me to be happy: 'Henry, smile!
why don't you ever smile?'
and then she would smile, to show me how, and it was the
saddest smile I ever saw
one day the goldfish died, all five of them,
they floated on the water, on their sides, their
eyes still open,
and when my father got home he threw them to the cat
there on the kitchen floor and we watched as my mother
smiled

"Do you remember me? or are you proud?"
Lightly advancing thro' her star-trimm'd crowd,
Ianthe said, and lookt into my eyes,
"A yes, a yes, to both: for Memory
Where you but once have been must ever be,
And at your voice Pride from his throne must rise."

It's funny how time slips away
On those long summer nights,
I had sat down at my balcony,
I had gazed at the stars,
I had cried all night,
I had cried tears` of 'Good -bye': But
I had to keep on going without your love
Living my life the way I choose to
Discovering the things that are left for me to do
Doing the things that I love
Let there be light
Don't give excuses
Don't wait for answers
Don't wait for tomorrow
Don't ask me why
No need to be angry anymore
No need to wait anymore
For this special day, special hour,
No need to fight, just follow him, because
The Lord has come to set you free
The Lord has come to take you home
A place with no more pain and sorrows
Where you will find comfort and peace
Maybe someday, you will meet me again
A time has come to say” Good-bye'
I'll remember you in my dreams
I'll remember you in my sleep
I'll remember you each day and every hour of the day
I'll remember you for all the good things you have done for me
I'll remember you for the special time we spent together.
I'll remember you in my prayers
I'll remember you for the kind of person you were
I'll remember you every night
I'll remember you for your special smiles and laughter
I'll remember you

I remember the day
When i saw you walk away
And i felt like i would never see you again
I cried the whole way home
And couldn't even say why
I remember the day
When i felt a little bit of my heart break
I remember it like it was yesterday
And you had nothing to say
It was my turn to walk away
I remember the day
When you first told me you loved me
I had waited so long to hear it
Even though i didn't, at first, believe it
But to hear it was so relieving
I remember the days
Of you and of me
Of everything we thought we'd be
Of everything we wanted to be
And me begging you to remember me
I'll always remember the day
When i watch you walk away
To start the next part of your life
And i'll pray to one day be a part of that walk
but i'll never forget that day
I'll remember every day
As if each moment
Happened yesterday

When you're feeling down and blue
Just remember I love you.
When people have been mean and untrue
Just remember I love you.
When you feel sad and depressed
Just remember I love you.
When you're lonely and feel the pain in your chest
Just remember I love you.
No matter what state of mood you're in
Just remember I love you.
I hope this simple phrase gives you comfort within...
Just remember I will always love you.

Dear moments, dearest, stay please don't go
Don't let long hours kill my heart
Poor heart you need me here I know
I wish to stay yet I must go
Then I'll die without you
Come come future dear moments wait for you
It's Fate who bids not you not me
It's once together once apart
Now drie your tears take what I say
When I've gone here you can still keep me
Within your heart I'll live a memory
Days come and go
Years pass quickly
Today's faithful friend
Might tomorrow betray
When years've passed
When faces changed
Might you dear friend
Remember me!

Do you not remember me
The one who set your feelings free
And brought you to your knees...............
Do you not recall the days
You threw away your careless ways
And lost your heart to me....................
Do you not relive those nights
Of wild abandon - timeless flights
Into a magic place...............................
Where I was all you needed then
Oh, surely you remember when
The world was ours alone....................
The magic still remains  with me
It hurts to know that you don't see
How much those moments meant............
In quiet times I hope you know
Deep in your heart I loved you so..............
And maybe shead a tear.

Oh yeah!
I know I’d find you!
Oh, oh, oh.
I got you like I said!
I told you I never lie.
You were built for shame.
So get up because you’re not dead.
There’s and old saying that goes like this:
“I clean up after myself when I’m tied up”
I can’t find out, No you can’t find it!
You make me sick!
You will regret this.
You owe me this.

Well I remember how you smiled
To see me write your name upon
The soft sea-sand . . . "O! what a child!
You think you're writing upon stone!"
I have since written what no tide
Shall ever wash away, what men
Unborn shall read o'er ocean wide
And find Ianthe's name again.

A man should have respect
His case may not accord him that,
Nor his situation
Yet he must feel self worth.
A man must have respect
He may be poor
And destitute
But he is a child of God.
He is a spark of the Spirit
He is a wonder in himself
He is unique
The greatest of animals.
A man will have respect
Primordiality may refuse him it
But he will strive all he may
To clinch it still.

If you pay respect to where respect is due
And to your own higher self try to remain true
And treat everyone as an equal and all as the same
Your's ought to live on as a remembered name.
If for everyone you believe on a 'fair go'
And despite their Race or Creed due respect to them show
And never ruin anyone's character with malicious lies
Above the ordinary you are one who does seem to rise.
If you unlike many not addicted to greed
And try to help those of help who are in need
And of your own Human flaws you do feel aware
To say the least people like you are quite rare.
If you do believe in the live and let live
And you are not too proud to receive and generous enough for to give
And respect to the rights of all others you pay
Then as a person you are doing quite okay.

We must bravely reject the deeds of the wicked
Which offer nothing but false pleasures and tears.
The Devil serves up his lies of mistrust
Plotting we'll remain prisoners of our fears.
When we fail to submit to the will of God
We pay attention to all the wrong voices.
We fall prey to deception and refuse to obey
The Lord's love to improve our choices
God's wisdom is measured by the outcomes of life
And how we keep our desires and untruths in check.
If we excuse our wrongs and always blame others
We suffer the loss of love, joy, trust and respect

respect!
for all that lives,
for all that breathes...
for life itself in all
its constantly evolving forms....
for every moment,
for every casual brush
of a caring hand...
for the individuality and
the differences...
for in the differences
we find sameness!
not to change
a rainbow to
a mountain...
a hawk into
a turtle....
but to take each
as it is... realizing
its beauty and its worth....
respect!
knowing that what you feel,
i feel... what you need,
i need...
one breath of life,
many forms,
molded by the spirit
of compassionate energy!
respect!

Respect is earned
Respect is given
Respect is not demanded
Respect is not forced
To give others respect
Is our tradition our culture
My dear, forget not
As you sow so you reap
Go on your own trip
The engine of respect
You see it is auto
Never bother who says what
You say whatever you like
As freedom of speech is there .

respect the finger
that points the way.
the hand that takes yours,
the feet walking by your side.
the breath shared,
and the sweat mingled.
respect the scars that
remind you of yourself....
respect the love
that gives all without regret!

Respect! Respect!
Time I respect you
Time is of great essence
Respect time
Before it imposes on you a sentence
As if you have committed a crime
Time is precious like a diamond
Time must come first never second
Respect time
For time itself is the sublime
Time never waits
Time decides fates
In time itself you create
The food you eat off your plate
In time itself you love and hate
And find a partner or some mates
Respect time, underrate it not
Don’t say ‘time passed, I forgot’
There is a time to be late
There is a time to debate
There is a time to wait for someone
Before time decides to shorten the fun
Remember time waits for no one
Time also catches up with those on the run
Respect time
The essence of time
Is its continuous presence
And its everlasting absence
And denial of the past tense

'Your only enemy
is yourself'...
Easy to say?
Prove me wrong.

I am sitting in the back of the bus
Observing the children play
With the weather just gorgeous
On a very lovely day
A mother of two
Tries to discipline her son
He just would not listen
He just wanted to have fun
As the mother told him to sit down
He raised his foot at her
I couldn't believe what I saw
I was left in a stare
Where is the respect
Has this boy lost his mind
The situation is looking bleak
As the boy's behavior is so unkind

Inside the river are
the sky, the cloud, and the sun.
In my hands’ bowl is the river.
If I throw up my hands,
the river spills in drops, scattering
sky, cloud, and sun all o’er me.
From my hands’ bowl, if I drink
the river, then within me,
the sun, the cloud, and the sky.
Tell me, who is in who?

FLOW on, ye lays so loved, so fair,
On to Oblivion's ocean flow!
May no rapt boy recall you e'er,
No maiden in her beauty's glow!
My love alone was then your theme,
But now she scorns my passion true.
Ye were but written in the stream;
As it flows on, then, flow ye too!

Clear Ancor, on whose silver-sanded shore
My soul-shrin'd saint, my fair Idea lies,
O blessed brook, whose milk-white swans adore
Thy crystal stream, refined by her eyes,
Where sweet myrrh-breathing Zephyr in the spring
Gently distills his nectar-dropping showers,
Where nightingales in Arden sit and sing
Amongst the dainty dew-impearled flowers;
Say thus, fair brook, when thou shalt see thy queen:
Lo, here thy shepherd spent his wand'ring years,
And in these shades, dear nymph, he oft hath been,
And here to thee he sacrific'd his tears.
Fair Arden, thou my Tempe art alone,
And thou, sweet Ancor, art my Helicon.

FLOW soft RIVER, gently stray,
Still a silent waving tide
O'er thy glitt'ring carpet glide,
While I chaunt my ROUNDELAY,
As I gather from thy bank,
Shelter'd by the poplar dank,
King-cups, deck'd in golden pride,
Harebells sweet, and daisies pied;
While beneath the evening sky,
Soft the western breezes fly.
Gentle RIVER, should'st thou be
Touch'd with mournful sympathy,
When reflection tells my soul,
Winter's icy breath shall quell
Thy sweet bosom's graceful swell,
And thy dimpling course controul;
Should a crystal tear of mine,
Fall upon thy lucid breast,
Oh receive the trembling guest,
For 'tis PITY'S drop divine!
GENTLE ZEPHYR, softly play,
Shake thy dewy wings around,
Sprinkle odours o'er the ground,
While I chaunt my ROUNDELAY.
While the woodbine's mingling shade,
Veils my pensive, drooping head;
Fan, oh fan, the busy gale,
That rudely wantons round my cheek,
Where the tear of suff'rance meek,
Glitters on the LILY pale:
Ah! no more the damask ROSE,
There in crimson lustre glows;
Thirsty fevers from my lip
Dare the ruddy drops to sip;
Deep within my burning heart,
Sorrow plants an icy dart;
From whose point the soft tears flow,
Melting in the vivid glow;
Gentle Zephyr, should'st thou be
Touch'd with tender sympathy;
When reflection calls to mind,
The bleak and desolating wind,
That soon thy silken wing shall tear,
And waft it on the freezing air;
Zephyr, should a tender sigh
To thy balmy bosom fly,
Oh! receive the flutt'ring thing,
Place it on thy filmy wing,
Bear it to its native sky,
For 'tis PITY'S softest sigh.
O'er the golden lids of day
Steals a veil of sober grey;
Now the flow'rets sink to rest,
On the moist earth's glitt'ring breast;
Homeward now I'll bend my way,
AND CHAUNT MY PLAINTIVE ROUNDELAY.

What do you mean by river?
Is it only mere water?
Is it flood water or dry river?
River, I know, my life my notion
The lifelines of my civilization.
River goes on long journey towards the sea
I go on long journey through this body towards my Master, Almighty.
My life is the purest life, see, watch, observe
My life is unique, highly developed
Fresh air fresh mind fresh water fresh thought
I am in need to flow smoothly to my Master, Almighty.
Rainy and summer all experienced by the river
O my dear, I experienced my sadness and happiness
And care not and I flow with the time
To receive His grace here.
Eighty four lakhs of Yonis or births I have crossed
And reached so far at this human life's entrance gate
Of my Master and I have listened  what He told me
At the outer of my life come on come on I am here I am here
Telling me river at the ocean's outer and in the deep
Deep ocean you may say milk-ocean You are my Master, my dear
Come on come on You are telling me and I am
Flowing with pleasure with the time-river.

'Twas in the year of 1887, and on the 28th of September,
Which many people of Honan, in China, will long remember;
Especially those that survived the mighty deluge,
That fled to the mountains, and tops of trees, for refuge.
The river burst its embankments suddenly at dead of night,
And the rushing torrent swept all before it left and right;
All over the province of Honan, which for its fertility,
Is commonly called by historians, the garden of China.
The river was at its fullest when the embankment gave way,
And when the people heard it, oh! horror and dismay;
'Twas then fathers and mothers leaped from their beds without delay,
And some saved themselves from being drowned, but thousands were swept away.
Oh! it was a horrible and most pitiful scene,
To hear fathers and mothers and their children loudly scream;
As the merciless water encircled they bodies around,
While the water spirits laughed to see them drowned.
Oh! heaven, it must have been an appalling sight,
To witness in the dead stillness of the night
Frantic fathers and mothers, struggling hard against the roaring flood,
To save themselves and little ones, their own. flesh and blood.
The watchmen tried to patch the breach, but it was all in vain,
Because the banks were sodden with the long prolonged rain;
And driven along by a high wind, which brought the last strain,
Which caused the water with resistless fury to spread o'er the plain.
And the torrent poured into the valley of the La Chia river,
Sweeping thousands of the people before it ere a helping hand could them deliver;
Oh! it was horrible to hear the crashing of houses fallen on every side,
As the flood of rushing waters spread far and wide.
The Chinese offer sacrifices to the water spirits twice a year,
And whether the water spirits or God felt angry I will not aver;
But perhaps God has considered such sacrifices a sin,
And has drowned so many thousands of them for not worshipping Him.
How wonderful are the works of God,
At times among His people abroad;
Therefore, let us be careful of what we do or say,
For fear God doth suddenly take our lives away.
The province of Honan is about half the size of Scotland,
Dotted over with about 3000 villages, most grand;
And inhabited by millions of people of every degree,
And these villages, and people were transformed into a raging sea.
The deluge swept on over the fertile and well-cultivated land,
And the rushing of the mighty torrent no power could withstand;
And the appalling torrent was about twenty feet deep,
And with resistless fury everything before it it did sweep.
Methinks I see the waste of surging waters, and hear its deafening roar,
And on its surface I see corpses of men and women by the score;
And the merciless torrent in the darkness of the night,
Sportively tossing them about, oh! what a horrible sight.
Besides there were buffaloes and oxen, timber, straw, and grain,
Also three thousand villages were buried beneath the waters of the plain;
And multitudes beneath their own roofs have found a watery grave,
While struggling hard, no doubt, poor souls their lives to save.
Therefore good people at home or abroad,
Be advised by me and trust more in God,
Than the people of Honan, the benighted Chinese,
For fear God punished you likewise for your iniquities.

The more we live, more brief appear
Our life's succeeding stages;
A day to childhood seems a year,
And years like passing ages.
The gladsome current of our youth,
Ere passion yet disorders,
Steals lingering like a river smooth
Along its grassy borders.
But as the careworn cheek grows wan,
And sorrow's shafts fly thicker,
Ye stars, that measure life to man,
Why seem your courses quicker?
When joys have lost their bloom and breath,
And life itself is vapid,
Why, as we reach the Falls of Death
Feel we its tide more rapid?
It may be strange—yet who would change
Time's course to slower speeding,
When one by one our friends have gone,
And left our bosoms bleeding?
Heaven gives our years of fading strength
Indemnifying fleetness;
And those of youth, a seeming length,
Proportion'd to their sweetness.

I'M now disposed to give a pretty tale;
Love laughs at what I've sworn and will prevail;
Men, gods, and all, his mighty influence know,
And full obedience to the urchin show.
In future when I celebrate his flame,
Expressions not so warm will be my aim;
I would not willingly abuses plant,
But rather let my writings spirit want.
If in these verses I around should twirl,
Some wily knave and easy simple girl,
'Tis with intention in the breast to place;
On such occasions, dread of dire disgrace;
The mind to open, and the sex to set
Upon their guard 'gainst snares so often met.
Gross ignorance a thousand has misled,
For one that has been hurt by what I've said.
I'VE read that once, an orator renowned
In Greece, where arts superior then were found,
By law's severe decree, compelled to quit
His country, and to banishment submit,
Resolved that he a season would employ,
In visiting the site of ancient Troy.
His comrade, Cymon, with him thither went,
To view those ruins, we so oft lament.
A hamlet had been raised from Ilion's wall,
Ennobled by misfortune and its fall;
Where now mere names are Priam and his court;
Of all devouring Time the prey and sport.
O TROY! for me thy very name has got
Superior charms:--in story fruitful spot;
Thy famed remains I ne'er can hope to view,
That gods by labour raised, and gods o'erthrew;
Those fields where daring acts of valour shone;
So many fights were lost:--so many won.
BUT to resume my thread, and not extend
Too much the subjects which our plan suspend;
This Cymon, who's the hero of our tale,
When walking near the banks that form the dale
Through which Scamander's waters freely flow,
Observed a youthful charmer thither go,
To breathe the cool refreshing breeze around;
That on its verdant borders oft she'd found.
Her veil was floating, and her artless dress,
A shepherdess seemed clearly to express.
Tall, elegantly formed, with beauteous mien,
And ev'ry feature lovely to be seen,
Young Cymon felt emotion and surprise,
And thought 'twas Venus that had caught his eyes,
Who on the river's side her charms displayed,
Those wondrous treasures all perfection made.
A GROT was nigh, to which the simple fair,
Not dreaming ills, was anxious to repair;
The heat, some evil spirit, and the place,
Invited her the moment to embrace,
To bathe within the stream that near her ran;
And instantly her project she began.
THE spark concealed himself; each charm admired;
Now this, now that, now t'other feature fired;
A hundred beauties caught his eager sight;
And while his bosom felt supreme delight,
He turned his thoughts advantages to take,
And of the maiden's error something make;
Assumed the character, and dress; and air;
That should a wat'ry deity declare;
Within the gliding flood his vestments dipt:
A crown of rushes on his head he slipt;
Aquatick herbs and plants around he twined:
Then Mercury intreated to be kind,
And Cupid too, the wily god of hearts;
How could the innocent resist these arts?
AT length a foot so fair the belle exposed,
E'en Galatea never such disclosed;
The stream, that glided by, received the prize;
Her lilies she beheld with downcast eyes,
And, half ashamed, herself surveyed at ease,
While round the zephyrs wantoned in the breeze.
WHEN thus engaged, the lover near her drew;
At whose approach away the damsel flew,
And tried to hide within the rocky cell;
Cried Cymon, I beneath these waters dwell,
And o'er their course a sov'reign right maintain;
Be goddess of the flood, and with me reign;
Few rivers could with you like pow'rs divide;
My crystal's clear: in me you may confide;
My heart is pure; with flow'rs I'll deck the stream,
If worthy of yourself the flood you deem;
Too happy should this honour you bestow,
And with me, 'neath the current, freely go.
Your fair companions, ev'ry one I'll make
A nymph of fountains, hill, or grove, or lake;
My pow'r is great, extending far around
Where'er the eye can reach, 'tis fully found.
THE eloquence he used, her fears and dread;
Lest she might give offence by what she said,
In spite of bashfulness that bliss alloys,
Soon all concluded with celestial joys.
'Tis even said that Cupid lent supplies;
From superstition many things arise.
THE spark withdrew, delighted by success;
Return said he:--we'll mutually caress;
But secret prove: let none our union learn;
Concealment is to me of high concern;
To make it publick would improper be,
Till on Olympus' mount the gods we see,
In council met, to whom I'll state the case;
On this the new-made goddess left the place,
In ev'ry thing contented as a dove,
And fully witnessed by the god of love.
Two months had passed, and not a person knew
Their frequent meetings, pleasure to pursue.
O mortals! is it true, as we are told,
That ev'ry bliss at last is rendered cold?
The sly gallant, though not a word he said,
The grot to visit now was rarely led.
AT length a wedding much attention caught;
The lads and lasses of the hamlet sought,
To see the couple pass: the belle perceived
The very man for whom her bosom heaved,
And loudly cried, behold Scamander's flood!
Which raised surprise; soon numbers round her stood,
Astonishment expressed, but still the fair,
Whate'er was asked, would nothing more declare,
Than, in the spacious, blue, ethereal sky,
Her marriage would be soon, they might rely.
A laugh prevailed; for what was to be done?
The god with hasty steps away had run,
And none with stones pursued his rapid flight:
The deity was quickly ought of sight.
WERE this to happen now, Scamander's stream
Would not so easily preserve esteem;
But crimes like these (whoever was abused),
In former days, were easily excused.
With time our maxims change, and what was then,
Though wrong at present, may prevail agen.
Scamander's spouse some raillery received;
But in the end she fully was relieved:
A lover e'en superior thought her charms,
(His taste was such) and took her to his arms.
The gods can nothing spoil! but should they cause
A belle to lose a portion of applause,
A handsome fortune give, and you'll behold,
That ev'ry thing can be repaired by gold.

Upon the shaded river bank
Where willows weep on water's edge,
And drape the sympathetic shore
That to my heart shall yield,
Some comfort as I sit and rest
And gaze across the surface calm
A mirror of the August sky
And pray my wounds be healed.
I listen as the birds do sing
Upon the boughs that gently move,
Within the breeze that softly calls
Her sweet name unto me,
A breath so warm with tender touch
That melts the chill of lonely days,
But yet I know she'll never come
To end my misery.
Upon the shaded river bank
My only thoughts to be with her,
And so these tears shall never dry
Until I find relief,
The graceful swan who swims alone
And so forlornly bows her head,
As she does search in vain for love
I too now share her grief.

There were thick leaves above me and around,
And low sweet sighs like those of childhood's sleep,
Amidst their dimness, and a fitful sound
As of soft showers on water; dark and deep
Lay the oak shadows o'er the turf, so still
They seem'd but pictured glooms: a hidden rill
Made music, such as haunts us in a dream,
Under the fern-tufts; and a tender gleam
Of soft green light, as by the glow-worm shed,
Came pouring thro' the woven beech-boughs down,
And steep'd the magic page wherein I read
Of royal chivalry and old renown,
A tale of Palestine. Meanwhile the bee
Swept past me with a tone of summer hours,
A drowsy bugle, wafting thoughts of flowers,
Blue skies, and amber sunshine: brightly free,
On filmy wings the purple dragon-fly
Shot glancing like a fairy javelin by;
And a sweet voice of sorrow told the dell
Where sat the lone wood-pigeon:
But ere long,
All sense of these things faded, as the spell
Breathing from that high gorgeous tale grew strong
On my chain'd soul: 'twas not the leaves I heard
A Syrian wind the Lion-banner stirr'd,
Thro' its proud, floating folds: 'twas not the brook,
Singing in secret thro' its grassy glen;
A wild shrill trumpet of the Saracen
Peal'd from the desert's lonely heart, and shook
The burning air. Like clouds when winds are high,
O'er glittering sands flew steeds of Araby,
And tents rose up, and sudden lance and spear
Flash'd where a fountain's diamond wave lay clear,
Shadow'd by graceful palm-trees. Then the shout
Of merry England's joy swell'd freely out,
Sent thro' an eastern heaven, whose glorious hue
Made shields dark mirrors to its depths of blue:
And harps were there; I heard their sounding strings,
As the waste echoed to the mirth of kings.
The bright masque faded. Unto life's worn track,
What call'd me from its flood of glory, back?
A voice of happy childhood! and they pass'd,
Banner, and harp, and Paynim's trumpet's blast;
Yet might I scarce bewail the splendours gone,
My heart so leap'd to that sweet laughter's tone.

The memories embracing me, you see
as beautiful as they might be
they're tearing me apart
my already weak heart
This life is just a cruel game
this world, is a shame
conflicting stories, lovers torn apart
without the change of a new start
I was getting into the way of evil might
I lost everything that night
without your sudden appearance I'd have died
but your beautiful wings took me into the height
These arms around me with loving care
what else could I loose if we'd dare
beautifully entwining bodies, bare
anything I have, I want to share
Hot kisses on cold skin
let's commit the sweetest sin
feel the impact of loving
take away my grieving
Never thought it would find such an end
the one you called friend
to bring me death he was send
without you being there to defend
Now, with the time, all the centuries flowing
I still feel my longing for you growing
but will you now ever be knowing
that I'm waiting for you under the stars, the glowing

The definition of love
Is when the woman
You're with
Is the only woman
In the world.
The definition of romance
Is when the woman
You're with
Is every woman
In the world.

It’s February and romance is in the air.
Shops are filled with things to give your lady fair.
Heart shaped items to express I love you
for both men and women to confess their love is true.
Someone somewhere is making a big fat profit out of this
and certainly isn’t me.
Florist jack their prices up just for Valentines Day.
In Fact, everyone does the same,
because they know only too well
people are going to buy them of pay the consequence,
and consequence could be nasty.
Therefore, if you see someone
with a rolling pin implanted in their head,
or a frying pan with a big dent in it
you will know someone has forgotten
and paid the consequence.

Dear, you learn by mind
Memoirs of yesterdays
Dear, know me again

Upcoming world of love
Dear, you learn by heart
Memoirs of yesterdays
Wait on reflective romance
I still be devoted to you

Tracks of rain and light linger in
the spongy greens of a nature whose
flickering mountain--bulging nearer,
ebbing back into the sun
hollowing itself away to hold a lake,--
or brown stream rising and falling at the roadside, turning about,
churning itself white, drawing
green in over it,--plunging glassy funnels
fall--
And--the other world--
the windshield a blunt barrier:
Talk to me. Sh! they would hear us.
--the backs of their heads facing us--
The stream continues its motion of
a hound running over rough ground.
Trees vanish--reappear--vanish:
detached dance of gnomes--as a talk
dodging remarks, glows and fades.
--The unseen power of words--
And now that a few of the moves
are clear the first desire is
to fling oneself out at the side into
the other dance, to other music.
Peer Gynt. Rip Van Winkle. Diana.
If I were young I would try a new alignment--
alight nimbly from the car, Good-bye!--
Childhood companions linked two and two
criss-cross: four, three, two, one.
Back into self, tentacles withdrawn.
Feel about in warm self-flesh.
Since childhood, since childhood!
Childhood is a toad in the garden, a
happy toad. All toads are happy
and belong in gardens. A toad to Diana!
Lean forward. Punch the steerman
behind the ear. Twirl the wheel!
Over the edge! Screams! Crash!
The end. I sit above my head--
a little removed--or
a thin wash of rain on the roadway
--I am never afraid when he is driving,--
interposes new direction,
rides us sidewise, unforseen
into the ditch! All threads cut!
Death! Black. The end. The very end--
I would sit separate weighing a
small red handful: the dirt of these parts,
sliding mists sheeting the alders
against the touch of fingers creeping
to mine. All stuff of the blind emotions.
But--stirred, the eye seizes
for the first time--The eye awake!--
anything, a dirt bank with green stars
of scrawny weed flattened upon it under
a weight of air--For the first time!--
or a yawning depth: Big!
Swim around in it, through it--
all directions and find
vitreous seawater stuff--
God how I love you!--or, as I say,
a plunge into the ditch. The End. I sit
examining my red handful. Balancing
--this--in and out--agh.
Love you? It's
a fire in the blood, willy-nilly!
It's the sun coming up in the morning.
Ha, but it's the grey moon too, already up
in the morning. You are slow.
Men are not friends where it concerns
a woman? Fighters. Playfellows.
White round thighs! Youth! Sighs--!
It's the fillip of novelty. It's--
Mountains. Elephants humping along
against the sky--indifferent to
light withdrawing its tattered shreds,
worn out with embraces. It's
the fillip of novelty. It's a fire in the blood.
Oh get a flannel shirt, white flannel
or pongee. You'd look so well!
I married you because I liked your nose.
I wanted you! I wanted you
in spite of all they'd say--
Rain and light, mountain and rain,
rain and river. Will you love me always?
--A car overturned and two crushed bodies
under it.--Always! Always!
And the white moon already up.
White. Clean. All the colors.
A good head, backed by the eye--awake!
backed by the emotions--blind--
River and mountain, light and rain--or
rain, rock, light, trees--divided:
rain-light counter rocks-trees or
trees counter rain-light-rocks or--
Myriads of counter processions
crossing and recrossing, regaining
the advantage, buying here, selling there
--You are sold cheap everywhere in town!--
lingering, touching fingers, withdrawing
gathering forces into blares, hummocks,
peaks and rivers--rivers meeting rock
--I wish that you were lying there dead
and I sitting here beside you.--
It's the grey moon--over and over.
It's the clay of these parts.

the bud firmly holds
the ecstasy of the kiss,
in fast bloom
it doesn’t want to miss.
but in the bloom
hug-warmth’s
new heights are told,
bliss within
to the world is unfold.
the Nature is filled
with romance all around,
the parallel of its blissful romance
is nowhere found.

Tipped toe-ly
Dusk droops,
Plays with
Naive teen.
She fills up
Stoic beech wood
With rustle and sigh.
Ripples whisper
O’ teen
Do you hear: Love?
From moon.
Teen bewildered
Say what; She..?
Love had pored, she-
On Romance Point,
Fragrance smeared
Feet of
Her…?
She quests for!

There was a young patrolman who
Had large but tender feet;
They always hurt him badly when
He walked upon his beat.
(He always took them with him when
He walked upon his beat.)
His name was Patrick Casey and
A sweetheart fair had he;
Her face was full of freckles—but
Her name was Kate McGee.
(It was in spite of freckles that
Her name was Kate McGee.)
'Oh, Pat!' she said, 'I’ll wed you when
Promotion comes to you!'
'I’m much-obliged,' he answered, and
'I’ll see what I can do.'
(I may remark he said it thus—
'Oi’ll say phwat Oi kin do.')
So then he bought some new shoes which
Allowed his feet more ease—
They may have been large twelves. Perhaps
Eighteens, or twenty-threes.
(That’s rather large for shoes, I think—
Eighteens or twenty-threes!)
What last they were I don’t know, but
Somehow it seems to me
I’ve heard somewhere they either were
A, B, C, D, or E.
(More likely they were five lasts wide—
A, B plus C, D, E.)
They were the stoutest cowhide that
Could be peeled off a cow.
But he was not promoted
So
Kate wed him anyhow.
(This world is crowded full of Kates
That wed them anyhow.)

The whole world is just
One romantic dramatic comedy
Horror after another
Each person
That hopeless romantic
Triumphant lowlife, scoundrel,
Angel, model
That we see every day
Every kiss is love
Every loss the worst
Things start to loose their meanings
In this same old romance
Comediatric dramatic horror series
With way to many seasons
Once a hit
Now watched
Out of pity
Waiting for another character
To get killed off
So they can return
To their own romantic
Comedy drama horror life cliché
Hoping one day
The movies won’t be able to say enough
To call it a romantic
Comedy horror drama
Of a life

Shall I just stand and let the eyes drink,
The wine in the petals is shocking pink,
Inhale your aroma and watch your dance,
Join naughty winds in a rainy romance,
Shall I touch you with the lover's lips?
But I know for me aren't nectar sips,
As you are smiling for the butterflies,
The colorful Angels from the skies,
Who is hidden in you, could you speak!
You are soft but dense, you'll never leak.
But the eyes of a lover with a lovely peep,
See Him smiling in your soul so deep

Good imagery in SILENCE
SILENTLY! ! ! ! ! ! !
but
this is one is like a Swan dance
compose accordingly
and
please reply all those who comment
else one day you will lament
time is wasted
all is spent...
I'd rather kiss her lips
when I'm kickingalive
who knows who
where in heaven
we will ever meet
Love if at all lies here
Dav
be more pragmatic next time
when you to meet
lie as in lay
just don't lie
kiss her eyes
and
kiss your own nose
as you plant yourself
against a mirror
when all alone
dews/drops.... fall
as a guy you know
..LOVE IS THE ONLY ONE WORD
FOR ALL WHICHHANKER
Life is just an accident
born out of love
and blessed are those who become the outcome
of such a rendition
and a fresh life is born
but in another form
we reincarnate
if at all to be another one
in love to be born again and again
but in different form
come love me
O poet
if you want tojust for once
come in the torrential rain
and with me drench
remove all your attire
we are divine aren't we...
they need no clothes
why not we like them be
the UNIVERSE is vast
none can all see
just ADMIRE THE POET
in poet me
all love and poetry
is IMAGERY! ! !
May appear sexy to ye
may be

Poetess is very happy today and in romantic mood
For her love is the only passion and food
She has Chris on hand to go with
Full with deep love and armed with teeth
What moon, earth or for that matter anything
She has needed none or expects something
Since weeks she had prepared beautiful ground
Now naturally she will be drunk and found
All her eagerness may come to an end
In Chris she has found an ally and friend
What else she has needed to enjoy?
No stars, no sky and no moon to joy
Let her explain what happened on that day
How did she enjoyed it till long night stay
What did he get in return for complete surrender?
Who was winner in race? Female or male gender
Let it remain there as their private domain
They might have talked about loneliness and pain
We may hear the version form poetess's encounter
let her take complete world by storm and enter

THERE’S a rare Soul of Poesy which may be
But concentrated by the chastened dreams
Of constant hearts. Where’er the ministry
Of beautiful Nature hath enhanced the themes
Of some Petrarchian mind whose story gleams
Within the Past like a moon-silvered sea,
Or where grey Interest the spirit free
Of faithful Love hath caged in iron schemes,
Or round it stirr’d such dangers as o’erdrove
Long Ruin’s storm at last—there evermore
The very airs that whisper to the grove,
The echo’s mystery and the streamlet’s lore
Savour of Passion and transfusive pour
Abroad suggestions to heroic Love.

Romance is full of challenges to deal with;
Romantic hero and heroine take them well!
Romantic story captures the hearts of youths;
Romeo and Juliet now all like to end in comedy!
Famous love stories are written to be tragedies;
Love touches all and lives longer than humans!
Famous love comedies are romance in novels
And movies are full of such stories to please all!
Only love is vital and most important in life
Of all the virtues man cherishes most in world!
For, with love comes all virtues to one in life
As love is divine as pretty Nature that inspires!
Romance makes life interesting to live in the world
And for the sake of love all hardships are endured!
Comedy or tragedy, love is the central theme here
That drives romantic life to go on all terrains sure!

Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
they wouldn't be red or blue,

Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
I'll be stuck to you,

Roses are red,

Whisper some Shakespeare in my ear.
Maybe a scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream.
Or better yet, copy a sonnet, longhand, complete
With misspelled words and archaic punctuation.
Send me a text referencing Eliot.
Offer to anaesthetize me and lay me on your table
Like a movable feast for a poor man
Who has nothing to give but another man's love.
Or just this once, speak to me.
In your words, from your soul.
Be pedestrian, be predictable, be cliché.
Say plain words in a plain way.
But make me want to listen
To the tone in your voice
To the catch in your throat
To the hitches and hesitations.
And then kiss me.
Let your lips tell me what your words can't.
And look for my reply in these blue eyes.
Then leave language behind for tonight.

O Rose! who dares to name thee?
No longer roseate now, nor soft, nor sweet;
But pale, and hard, and dry, as stubble-wheat,---
Kept seven years in a drawer---thy titles shame thee.
The breeze that used to blow thee
Between the hedgerow thorns, and take away
An odour up the lane to last all day,---
If breathing now,---unsweetened would forego thee.
The sun that used to smite thee,
And mix his glory in thy gorgeous urn,
Till beam appeared to bloom, and flower to burn,---
If shining now,---with not a hue would light thee.
The dew that used to wet thee,
And, white first, grow incarnadined, because
It lay upon thee where the crimson was,---
If dropping now,---would darken where it met thee.
The fly that lit upon thee,
To stretch the tendrils of its tiny feet,
Along thy leaf's pure edges, after heat,---
If lighting now,---would coldly overrun thee.
The bee that once did suck thee,
And build thy perfumed ambers up his hive,
And swoon in thee for joy, till scarce alive,---
If passing now,---would blindly overlook thee.
The heart doth recognise thee,
Alone, alone! The heart doth smell thee sweet,
Doth view thee fair, doth judge thee most complete,---
Though seeing now those changes that disguise thee.
Yes, and the heart doth owe thee
More love, dead rose! than to such roses bold
As Julia wears at dances, smiling cold!---
Lie still upon this heart---which breaks below thee!

THE red rose whispers of passion,
And the white rose breathes of love;
O, the red rose is a falcon,
And the white rose is a dove.
But I send you a cream-white rosebud
With a flush on its petal tips;
For the love that is purest and sweetest
Has a kiss of desire on the lips

I’ll tell you how the sun rose, -
A ribbon at a time.
The steeples swam in amethyst,
The news like squirrels ran.
The hills untied their bonnets,
The bobolinks begun.
Then I said softly to myself,
"That must have been the sun!"
But how he set, I know not.
There seemed a purple stile.
Which little yellow boys and girls
Were climbing all the while
Till when they reached the other side,
A dominie in gray
Put gently up the evening bars,
And led the flock away.

O gather me the rose, the rose,
While yet in flower we find it,
For summer smiles, but summer goes,
And winter waits behind it.
For with the dream foregone, foregone,
The deed foreborn forever,
The worm Regret will canker on,
And time will turn him never.
So were it well to love, my love,
And cheat of any laughter
The fate beneath us, and above,
The dark before and after.
The myrtle and the rose, the rose,
The sunshine and the swallow,
The dream that comes, the wish that goes
The memories that follow!

A saturated meadow,
Sun-shaped and jewel-small,
A circle scarcely wider
Than the trees around were tall;
Where winds were quite excluded,
And the air was stifling sweet
With the breath of many flowers, --
A temple of the heat.
There we bowed us in the burning,
As the sun's right worship is,
To pick where none could miss them
A thousand orchises;
For though the grass was scattered,
yet every second spear
Seemed tipped with wings of color,
That tinged the atmosphere.
We raised a simple prayer
Before we left the spot,
That in the general mowing
That place might be forgot;
Or if not all so favored,
Obtain such grace of hours,
that none should mow the grass there
While so confused with flowers.

The Grave said to the Rose,
"What of the dews of dawn,
Love's flower, what end is theirs?"
"And what of spirits flown,
The souls whereon doth close
The tomb's mouth unawares?"
The Rose said to the Grave.
The Rose said, "In the shade
From the dawn's tears is made
A perfume faint and strange,
Amber and honey sweet."
"And all the spirits fleet
Do suffer a sky-change,
More strangely than the dew,
To God's own angels new,"
The Grave said to the Rose.

The rose is a rose,
And was always a rose.
But the theory now goes
That the apple's a rose,
And the pear is, and so's
The plum, I suppose.
The dear only knows
What will next prove a rose.
You, of course, are a rose -
But were always a rose.

Beneath my chamber window
Pierrot was singing, singing;
I heard his lute the whole night thru
Until the east was red.
Alas, alas Pierrot,
I had no rose for flinging
Save one that drank my tears for dew
Before its leaves were dead.
I found it in the darkness,
I kissed it once and threw it,
The petals scattered over him,
His song was turned to joy;
And he will never know--
Alas, the one who knew it!
The rose was plucked when dusk was dim
Beside a laughing boy.

Tis the last rose of summer
Left blooming alone;
All her lovely companions
Are faded and gone:
No flower of her kindred,
No rose-bud is nigh,
To reflect back her blushes,
Or give sigh for sigh.
I'll not leave thee, thou lone one!
To pine on the stem;
Since the lovely are sleeping,
Go, sleep thou with them.
Thus kindly I scatter
Thy leaves o'er the bed,
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead.
So soon may I follow,
When friendships decay,
And from Love's shining circle
The gems drop away.
When true hearts lie wither'd,
And fond ones are flown,
Oh! who would inhabit
This bleak world alone?

When the bare feet of the baby beat across the grass
The little white feet nod like white flowers in the wind,
They poise and run like ripples lapping across the water;
And the sight of their white play among the grass
Is like a little robin’s song, winsome,
Or as two white butterflies settle in the cup of one flower
For a moment, then away with a flutter of wings.
I long for the baby to wander hither to me
Like a wind-shadow wandering over the water,
So that she can stand on my knee
With her little bare feet in my hands,
Cool like syringa buds,
Firm and silken like pink young peony flowers.

Dr. Death, aka Jack Kevorkian, is running for congress,
He is running for the 9th District seat in Michigan,
The incumbent Republican,
Joe Knollenberg to unseat
Jack is 79, and he looks like death warmed over,
He’ll be lucky to make to November,
He has to have 3,000 signatures for his name to be put on the ballot,
To bad he assisted suicides in many of his supporters,
-at least 130 of them.
His lawyer, Mayer Morganroth, is mum on the word,
His previous lawyer, Geoffery Feiger,
Argued that the society did not have The Knack to follow Dr. Death’s thinking.
They Shoot Horses Don’t They?
Was the contention.
Maybe he can assist the Democratic Party its fray,
To lead to a new direction.
They seem destined for a self destruct convention.

running away
from honesty
not touching
anything
not touched too
by anyone
you keep on
running and
running away?
no one is reached
no one reaches
for you
you keep on running
and running away
from no one
but yourself because
what you touch
bites you
and what you love
is always a stone
thrown at you
and so you keep on
running and running away
from honesty
and having gained speed
you have become the
fastest lie
that even the winds of
the northern seas
cannot catch even
a glimpse of
who you are.

I run
Barefoot and cold
Wanting to go where nobody has ever gone
To the moon or maybe even the stars
They all seem so far
But I'll find the right Place
Where I'll sit and wait
And hope and pray
That all these bad thoughts will go away
But I highly doubt it,
Because these memories are here to stay,
Untill they go black and fade away

Horrible past
Hoping for a good future
Tears in her eyes
Running to the preacher
Asking for advice in the end gaining none
Shes a fearful polar bear sitting in the sun
Trying to hurry and get on with life
She hates the attention, but loves to tell lies
Tries to make things better
But they only turn out worse
The role she's been playing
Plenty a' times rehearsed
Moot is her thinking
Testy is her soul
This running girl is running trying to find her fairy tale
And everyone is screaming
Wait look back at what you've missed
You've tried to zoom thru life not even pausing for a kiss
You're children are grown
You're husband in a nursing home
You all alone
Afraid to answer the telephone
Scared of love and afraid of being touched
Raped and abused in her past
Told she was worth to none
A running girl who never stop's to see who she has hurt
She never planned out her dreams
Always told she was dirt
Wrinkles in her face
Yet she still thinks she's twenty-one
Running girl stop running
Your shoes cant go on
You always wanted a mother
A father just to hold
A house she'd always stay in
No bags to pack and move
All she ever knew was how to run
She never looked away from her path
Never gazed up at the sun
Her children needed her but she struggled
to make it thru the day
Running girl slow down and listen to what your family has to say
Go see your husband and call your children too
Stop running, running girl
You cant afford another pair of shoes

They did not understand his smile
Or the quick pacing of his steps.
They did not understand
Why rumors did not affect him!
Neither gossip nor slander
Seemed to bother him at all!
And when they threw him out...
Locking the door behind him,
They were amazed to discover him...
Laughing and swinging on the swing,
In the backyard!
They could not sleep at night...
Even medicated!
Why?
They questioned!
Why is he doing 'this' to US?
And no one thought to change the locks!
And 'he' had the key!
He also owned the house and the property!
And he knew...
They were living on borrowed time!
His!
They believed they were doing him a favor,
By gracing him with 'their' presence!
And he enjoyed them not knowing...
He was running out of patience!

Running race was over;
Rabbit was musing hard
How come he lost to her?
Shameful and sad; so bad
As outside darkness spread
From inside of his heart,
He met her in her nest;
Asked how she managed that
Tortoise smiled and said:
Over those drinks you had,
Inside those pumping talks,
Last night two pills I packed!
28th May 2009

She was running late. Her family had crossed the road ahead of her and now out of sight. Normally they would have waited, but today was just not a normal day and they were all looking forward to a restful night.
It was her running late that made her careless. It’s amazing how we forget to do the things we teach our kids. She ran right into the road without a single glance. She didn’t even see the late model pickup that didn’t see her until it was too late.
Things weren’t right for a few moments. She wasn’t sure what happened – one moment she was crossing the road chasing her family and the next she was laying on it. Why couldn’t she move her arms and legs? Why couldn’t she feel anything?
Help! ? !
Help! ? – did she really just say that out loud?
Was someone coming? Yes! A man was coming closer. All she could do was lift her head up to look at him. That’s strange. Why was he carrying a rifle? Who was he talking to on the cell phone?
The next to last thing she heard was the driver of the truck telling his wife that he would be late. He had hit a deer on the road and needed to put her out of her misery.

Time is running out I've heard
2012 fast approaching!
The experts claim that in that year
the earth might be destroyed
by something unknown encroaching.
I wonder what it might be this time?
Seems every year there's something new.
First asteroids from outer space bombarding earth
then destruction by, a man made few!
'No one knows the time or day'
when the earth might become that pile of ash!
It is all stated in Revelations, my dear friend
Placed in the Bible, that chapter written last.
So let 2012, one day roll on in!
there is nothing anyone can do.
But you had better pray, that every soul is saved
and that they're ready for,
two thousand one zero one two?

Oh no I’m late for school
The alarm woke me up late in the morn
Oh how could this happen?
I’m sure I had set the alarm right, I could have sworn
I was supposed to wake up at seven
But now its nearly eight
If I’m not on time my teacher will kill me
Or else she will use me for fishing as bait
In a total hustle bustle I tried to pack my bag
Oh now where is my math book gone?
And then I also realized I
Had left my pencil box in the lawn
Mom tried to stop me but I was too busy
To hear what she had to say
Without breakfast I ran to bus stop
Whilst the sun on me, cast its many a bright ray
I stood there waiting for my bus
Which always came at eight
But it didn’t arrive at all
Uh oh, was I too late?
At last I gave up hope
And came home to rest for the day
When my eyes fell on the calendar
And I realized today is a Sunday.

School Is Not So Cool
School, School, School,
A school is not cool
We're here 5 days a week
8 hours a day.
School, School, School,
A school is not cool.
People laugh when we fall
we just have to make a call.
School, School, School
A school is not cool.
We have to work hard to get good grades
I'm not going to do it no more
I do it every day.
We can’t go on the grass
We can’t bother another class
We can’t save spots at lunch
We have to go as a bunch.
We have 3 minutes in the hall
I'm always late what a ball.
We have to pay attention
if not we get detention.
School, School, School,
A school is not cool.
They have too many rules
they play us as fools
if we get A's
the parents jump Hip Hip Hooray.
If we get F's
we tell them we need to take a rest.
We always have homework
we never have class work
they have to many rules
they need to take it cool.
School, School, School,
A school is so not cool!

The boat ploughed on. Now Alcatraz was past
And all the grey waves flamed to red again
At the dead sun's last glimmer. Far and vast
The Sausalito lights burned suddenly
In little dots and clumps, as if a pen
Had scrawled vague lines of gold across the hills;
The sky was like a cup some rare wine fills,
And stars came as he watched
-- and he was free
One splendid instant -- back in the great room,
Curled in a chair with all of them beside
And the whole world a rush of happy voices,
With laughter beating in a clamorous tide. . . .
Saw once again the heat of harvest fume
Up to the empty sky in threads like glass,
And ran, and was a part of what rejoices
In thunderous nights of rain; lay in the grass
Sun-baked and tired, looking through a maze
Of tiny stems into a new green world;
Once more knew eves of perfume, days ablaze
With clear, dry heat on the brown, rolling fields;
Shuddered with fearful ecstasy in bed
Over a book of knights and bloody shields . . .
The ship slowed, jarred and stopped. There, straight ahead,
Were dock and fellows. Stumbling, he was whirled
Out and away to meet them -- and his back
Slumped to the old half-cringe, his hands fell slack;
A big boy's arm went round him -- and a twist
Sent shattering pain along his tortured wrist,
As a voice cried, a bloated voice and fat,
"Why it's Miss Nancy! Come along, you rat!"

in school,
when  i  saw  you
i  intuited  i  have  found
my  lost  world  in  you
i  wish  i  could  act
to  be  appreciated
by  you  in  school.
in school,
it  would  be too sad
to  narrate  the  ordeal
i  have  been  through
i  wonder  if  its  best
i  had  met you
in  the  school.
in  school,
though  i  had  not  said  it
there  has  been  so  many  ways
that  i have  shown  it
my  actions  had  done
whatever  i  wanted  to  say
at  school.
in  school,
i  never  thought
being  in  love
could  take  me  to  madness
well,  it  is  better  than
leaving  me  in  sadness
in  the  school.
in  school,
when i  approached  you
i  knew  i  was  silly
it  was  because
suddenly,
i  forgot  who  i  was
in  school
in  school,
why  do  you  sneer
when  i  am  near
it  really  breaks  me
just  tell  me  what  to  do
to  get  a  room  from  you
in and  out  of  school.
in school,
sometimes  though  it  is  hard
i  guess  i  must  let  go
some  things  i wish  to  have
though  good  things  also
could  be  found  elsewhere
as  it  has  been  in  school.

I guess we all have old memories
Way back when we were in school
We tried our best to get passing grades
To prove to our folks we weren’t a fool
Remember those old-fashion desks?
There was an ink well right at the top
Some boys didn’t last too long at school
For they stayed home to pick the crops
Long walks home right after school
The stack of books made a heavy load
Kicking rocks but hurrying along
Down that dusty red dirt road
After all, there were always chores to do
Once a kid got back home
Gather the eggs and slop the hogs
Didn’t have a lot of time to roam
Yep, those were good old days, my friend
Nowadays seems school is a breeze
But it sure is fun to look behind us
To the wonderful old school memories!

School, it is stressing at times.
Many times I don't even have it on my mind.
School is good, and it is bad, there are times I think that I'm
going to mad.
It is a good thing to go to school, so that you could remember the rules.
Don't be shy.
Don't be a fool.
Go to school, and learn all the rules.

O academic muse that hast for long
Charmed all the world with thy disciples’ song,
As myrtle bushes must give place to trees,
Our humbler strains can now no longer please.
Look down for once, inspire me in these lays.
In lofty verse to sing our Rector's praise.
The mighty wheel of Time to light has rolled
That golden age by ancient bards foretold.
Minerva now descends upon our land,
And scatters knowledge with unsparing hand;
Long since Ulysses saw the heavenly maid,
In Mentor's form and Mentor’s dress arrayed,
But now to Cambrian lands the goddess flies,
And drops in Williams’ form from out the skies;
And as at dawn the brilliant orb of light,
With his bright beams dispels the gloomy night,
So sunk in ignorance our land he finds,
But with his learning drives it from our minds,
And he, a hero, shall with joyful eyes
See crowds of heroes all around him rise;
With great Minerva's wisdom he shall rule
Those boisterous youths—the rector's class at school,
And when in the fifth class begins his power,
And he begins to teach us, from that hour
Dame Poetry begins to show her face,
And witty epigrams the plaster grace;
There growing wild are often to be seen
The names of boys that Duxes erst have been,
And at the chimney-piece is seen the same
All thickly scribbled with the boobie's name.

Ne’er shall the dreadful tawse be heard again,
The lash resounding, and the cry of pain;
Carmichael's self will change (O that he would!)
From the imperative to wishing mood;
Ye years roll on, and haste the expected time
When flogging boys shall be accounted crime.
But come, thy real nature let us see,
No more the rector but the goddess be,
Come in thy might and shake the deep profound,
Let the Academy with shouts resound,
While radiant glory all thy head adorns,
And slippers on thy feet protect thy corns;
O may I live so long on earth below,
That I may learn the things that thou dost know!
Then will I praise thee in heroic verse
So good that Linus’ will be counted worse;
The Thracian Orpheus never will compare
With me, nor Dods that got the prize last year.
But stay, O stay upon this earth a while,
Even now thou seest the world's approving smile,
And when thou goest to taste celestial joys,
Let thy great nephew teach the mourning boys,
Then mounting to the skies upon the wind,
Lead captive ignorance in chains behind.

When storm-clouds rumble in the sky and June showers come down.
The moist east wind comes marching over the heath to blow its
bagpipes among the bamboos.
Then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden, from nobody knows
where, and dance upon the grass in wild glee.
Mother, I really think the flowers go to school underground.
They do their lessons with doors shut, and if they want to
come out to play before it is time, their master makes them stand
in a corner.
When the rain come they have their holidays.
Branches clash together in the forest, and the leaves rustle
in the wild wind, the thunder-clouds clap their giant hands and the
flower children rush out in dresses of pink and yellow and white.
Do you know, mother, their home is in the sky, where the stars
are.
Haven't you see how eager they are to get there? Don't you
know why they are in such a hurry?
Of course, I can guess to whom they raise their arms; they
have their mother as I have my own.

.  Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much
Unvisited, endeavour'd to retrace
My life through its first years, and measured back
The way I travell'd when I first began
To love the woods and fields; the passion yet
Was in its birth, sustain'd, as might befal,
By nourishment that came unsought, for still,
From week to week, from month to month, we liv'd
A round of tumult: duly were our games
Prolong'd in summer till the day-light fail'd;
No chair remain'd before the doors, the bench
And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep
The Labourer, and the old Man who had sate,
A later lingerer, yet the revelry
Continued, and the loud uproar: at last,
When all the ground was dark, and the huge clouds
Were edged with twinkling stars, to bed we went,
With weary joints, and with a beating mind.
Ah! is there one who ever has been young,
Nor needs a monitory voice to tame
The pride of virtue, and of intellect?
And is there one, the wisest and the best
Of all mankind, who does not sometimes wish
For things which cannot be, who would not give,
If so he might, to duty and to truth
The eagerness of infantine desire?
A tranquillizing spirit presses now
On my corporeal frame: so wide appears
The vacancy between me and those days,
Which yet have such self-presence in my mind
That, sometimes, when I think of them, I seem
Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself
And of some other Being. A grey Stone
Of native rock, left midway in the Square
Of our small market Village, was the home
And centre of these joys, and when, return'd
After long absence, thither I repair'd,
I found that it was split, and gone to build
A smart Assembly-room that perk'd and flar'd
With wash and rough-cast elbowing the ground
Which had been ours. But let the fiddle scream,
And be ye happy! yet, my Friends! I know
That more than one of you will think with me
Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame
From whom the stone was nam'd who there had sate
And watch'd her Table with its huckster's wares
Assiduous, thro' the length of sixty years.
We ran a boisterous race; the year span round
With giddy motion. But the time approach'd
That brought with it a regular desire
For calmer pleasures, when the beauteous forms
Of Nature were collaterally attach'd
To every scheme of holiday delight,
And every boyish sport, less grateful else,
And languidly pursued.         When summer came
It was the pastime of our afternoons
To beat along the plain of Windermere
With rival oars, and the selected bourne
Was now an Island musical with birds
That sang for ever; now a Sister Isle
Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown
With lillies of the valley, like a field;
And now a third small Island where remain'd
An old stone Table, and a moulder'd Cave,
A Hermit's history. In such a race,
So ended, disappointment could be none,
Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:
We rested in the shade, all pleas'd alike,
Conquer'd and Conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,
And the vain-glory of superior skill
Were interfus'd with objects which subdu'd
And temper'd them, and gradually produc'd
A quiet independence of the heart.
And to my Friend, who knows me, I may add,
Unapprehensive of reproof, that hence
Ensu'd a diffidence and modesty,
And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,
The self-sufficing power of solitude.
No delicate viands sapp'd our bodily strength;
More than we wish'd we knew the blessing then
Of vigorous hunger, for our daily meals
Were frugal, Sabine fare! and then, exclude
A little weekly stipend, and we lived
Through three divisions of the quarter'd year
In pennyless poverty. But now, to School
Return'd, from the half-yearly holidays,
We came with purses more profusely fill'd,
Allowance which abundantly suffic'd
To gratify the palate with repasts
More costly than the Dame of whom I spake,
That ancient Woman, and her board supplied.
Hence inroads into distant Vales, and long
Excursions far away among the hills,
Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,
Or in the woods, or near a river side,
Or by some shady fountain, while soft airs
Among the leaves were stirring, and the sun
Unfelt, shone sweetly round us in our joy.
Nor is my aim neglected, if I tell
How twice in the long length of those half-years
We from our funds, perhaps, with bolder hand
Drew largely, anxious for one day, at least,
To feel the motion of the galloping Steed;
And with the good old Inn-keeper, in truth,
On such occasion sometimes we employ'd
Sly subterfuge; for the intended bound
Of the day's journey was too distant far
For any cautious man, a Structure famed
Beyond its neighbourhood, the antique Walls
Of that large Abbey which within the vale
Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built,
Stands yet, a mouldering Pile, with fractured Arch,
Belfry, and Images, and living Trees,
A holy Scene! along the smooth green turf
Our Horses grazed: to more than inland peace
Left by the sea wind passing overhead
(Though wind of roughest temper) trees and towers
May in that Valley oftentimes be seen,
Both silent and both motionless alike;
Such is the shelter that is there, and such
The safeguard for repose and quietness.
Our steeds remounted, and the summons given,
With whip and spur we by the Chauntry flew
In uncouth race, and left the cross-legg'd Knight,
And the stone-Abbot, and that single Wren
Which one day sang so sweetly in the Nave
Of the old Church, that, though from recent showers
The earth was comfortless, and, touch'd by faint
Internal breezes, sobbings of the place,
And respirations, from the roofless walls
The shuddering ivy dripp'd large drops, yet still,
So sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible Bird
Sang to itself, that there I could have made
My dwelling-place, and liv'd for ever there
To hear such music. Through the Walls we flew
And down the valley, and a circuit made
In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth
We scamper'd homeward. Oh! ye Rocks and Streams,
And that still Spirit of the evening air!
Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt
Your presence, when with slacken'd step we breath'd
Along the sides of the steep hills, or when,
Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea,
We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.
Upon the Eastern Shore of Windermere,
Above the crescent of a pleasant Bay,
There stood an Inn, no homely-featured Shed,
Brother of the surrounding Cottages,
But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset
With Chaises, Grooms, and Liveries, and within
Decanters, Glasses, and the blood-red Wine.
In ancient times, or ere the Hall was built
On the large Island, had this Dwelling been
More worthy of a Poet's love, a Hut,
Proud of its one bright fire, and sycamore shade.
But though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed
The threshold, and large golden characters
On the blue-frosted Signboard had usurp'd
The place of the old Lion, in contempt
And mockery of the rustic painter's hand,
Yet to this hour the spot to me is dear
With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay
Upon a slope surmounted by the plain
Of a small Bowling-green; beneath us stood
A grove; with gleams of water through the trees
And over the tree-tops; nor did we want
Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.
And there, through half an afternoon, we play'd
On the smooth platform, and the shouts we sent
Made all the mountains ring. But ere the fall
Of night, when in our pinnace we return'd
Over the dusky Lake, and to the beach
Of some small Island steer'd our course with one,
The Minstrel of our troop, and left him there,
And row'd off gently, while he blew his flute
Alone upon the rock; Oh! then the calm
And dead still water lay upon my mind
Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky
Never before so beautiful, sank down
Into my heart, and held me like a dream.
Thus daily were my sympathies enlarged,
And thus the common range of visible things
Grew dear to me: already I began
To love the sun, a Boy I lov'd the sun,
Not as I since have lov'd him, as a pledge
And surety of our earthly life, a light
Which while we view we feel we are alive;
But, for this cause, that I had seen him lay
His beauty on the morning hills, had seen
The western mountain touch his setting orb,
In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess
Of happiness, my blood appear'd to flow
With its own pleasure, and I breath'd with joy.
And from like feelings, humble though intense,
To patriotic and domestic love
Analogous, the moon to me was dear;
For I would dream away my purposes,
Standing to look upon her while she hung
Midway between the hills, as if she knew
No other region; but belong'd to thee,
Yea, appertain'd by a peculiar right
To thee and thy grey huts, my darling Vale!
Those incidental charms which first attach'd
My heart to rural objects, day by day
Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell
How Nature, intervenient till this time,
And secondary, now at length was sought
For her own sake. But who shall parcel out
His intellect, by geometric rules,
Split, like a province, into round and square?
Who knows the individual hour in which
His habits were first sown, even as a seed,
Who that shall point, as with a wand, and say,
'This portion of the river of my mind
Came from yon fountain?' Thou, my Friend! art one
More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee
Science appears but, what in truth she is,
Not as our glory and our absolute boast,
But as a succedaneum, and a prop
To our infirmity. Thou art no slave
Of that false secondary power, by which,
In weakness, we create distinctions, then
Deem that our puny boundaries are things
Which we perceive, and not which we have made.
To thee, unblinded by these outward shows,
The unity of all has been reveal'd
And thou wilt doubt with me, less aptly skill'd
Than many are to class the cabinet
Of their sensations, and, in voluble phrase,
Run through the history and birth of each,
As of a single independent thing.
Hard task to analyse a soul, in which,
Not only general habits and desires,
But each most obvious and particular thought,
Not in a mystical and idle sense,
But in the words of reason deeply weigh'd,
Hath no beginning.          Bless'd the infant Babe,
(For with my best conjectures I would trace
The progress of our Being) blest the Babe,
Nurs'd in his Mother's arms, the Babe who sleeps
Upon his Mother's breast, who, when his soul
Claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul,
Doth gather passion from his Mother's eye!
Such feelings pass into his torpid life
Like an awakening breeze, and hence his mind
Even [in the first trial of its powers]
Is prompt and watchful, eager to combine
In one appearance, all the elements
And parts of the same object, else detach'd
And loth to coalesce. Thus, day by day,
Subjected to the discipline of love,
His organs and recipient faculties
Are quicken'd, are more vigorous, his mind spreads,
Tenacious of the forms which it receives.
In one beloved presence, nay and more,
In that most apprehensive habitude
And those sensations which have been deriv'd
From this beloved Presence, there exists
A virtue which irradiates and exalts
All objects through all intercourse of sense.
No outcast he, bewilder'd and depress'd;
Along his infant veins are interfus'd
The gravitation and the filial bond
Of nature, that connect him with the world.
Emphatically such a Being lives,
An inmate of this  active universe;
From nature largely he receives; nor so
Is satisfied, but largely gives again,
For feeling has to him imparted strength,
And powerful in all sentiments of grief,
Of exultation, fear, and joy, his mind,
Even as an agent of the one great mind,
Creates, creator and receiver both,
Working but in alliance with the works
Which it beholds.--Such, verily, is the first
Poetic spirit of our human life;
By uniform control of after years
In most abated or suppress'd, in some,
Through every change of growth or of decay,
Pre-eminent till death.       From early days,
Beginning not long after that first time
In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch,
I held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart
I have endeavour'd to display the means
Whereby this infant sensibility,
Great birthright of our Being, was in me
Augmented and sustain'd. Yet is a path
More difficult before me, and I fear
That in its broken windings we shall need
The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing:
For now a trouble came into my mind
From unknown causes. I was left alone,
Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why.
The props of my affections were remov'd,
And yet the building stood, as if sustain'd
By its own spirit! All that I beheld
Was dear to me, and from this cause it came,
That now to Nature's finer influxes
My mind lay open, to that more exact
And intimate communion which our hearts
Maintain with the minuter properties
Of objects which already are belov'd,
And of those only. Many are the joys
Of youth; but oh! what happiness to live
When every hour brings palpable access
Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,
And sorrow is not there. The seasons came,
And every season to my notice brought
A store of transitory qualities
Which, but for this most watchful power of love
Had been neglected, left a register
Of permanent relations, else unknown,
Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude
More active, even, than 'best society',
Society made sweet as solitude
By silent inobtrusive sympathies,
And gentle agitations of the mind
From manifold distinctions, difference
Perceived in things, where to the common eye,
No difference is; and hence, from the same source
Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone,
In storm and tempest, or in starlight nights
Beneath the quiet Heavens; and, at that time,
Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound
To breathe an elevated mood, by form
Or image unprofaned; and I would stand,
Beneath some rock, listening to sounds that are
The ghostly language of the ancient earth,
Or make their dim abode in distant winds.
Thence did I drink the visionary power.
I deem not profitless those fleeting moods
Of shadowy exultation: not for this,
That they are kindred to our purer mind
And intellectual life; but that the soul,
Remembering how she felt, but what she felt
Remembering not, retains an obscure sense
Of possible sublimity, to which,
With growing faculties she doth aspire,
With faculties still growing, feeling still
That whatsoever point they gain, they still
Have something to pursue.       And not alone,
In grandeur and in tumult, but no less
In tranquil scenes, that universal power
And fitness in the latent qualities
And essences of things, by which the mind
Is mov'd by feelings of delight, to me
Came strengthen'd with a superadded soul,
A virtue not its own. My morning walks
Were early; oft, before the hours of School
I travell'd round our little Lake, five miles
Of pleasant wandering, happy time! more dear
For this, that one was by my side, a Friend
Then passionately lov'd; with heart how full
Will he peruse these lines, this page, perhaps
A blank to other men! for many years
Have since flow'd in between us; and our minds,
Both silent to each other, at this time
We live as if those hours had never been.
Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latch
Far earlier, and before the vernal thrush
Was audible, among the hills I sate
Alone, upon some jutting eminence
At the first hour of morning, when the Vale
Lay quiet in an utter solitude.
How shall I trace the history, where seek
The origin of what I then have felt?
Oft in these moments such a holy calm
Did overspread my soul, that I forgot
That I had bodily eyes, and what I saw
Appear'd like something in myself, a dream,
A prospect in my mind.       'Twere long to tell
What spring and autumn, what the winter snows,
And what the summer shade, what day and night,
The evening and the morning, what my dreams
And what my waking thoughts supplied, to nurse
That spirit of religious love in which
I walked with Nature. But let this, at least
Be not forgotten, that I still retain'd
My first creative sensibility,
That by the regular action of the world
My soul was unsubdu'd. A plastic power
Abode with me, a forming hand, at times
Rebellious, acting in a devious mood,
A local spirit of its own, at war
With general tendency, but for the most
Subservient strictly to the external things
With which it commun'd. An auxiliar light
Came from my mind which on the setting sun
Bestow'd new splendor, the melodious birds,
The gentle breezes, fountains that ran on,
Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obey'd
A like dominion; and the midnight storm
Grew darker in the presence of my eye.
Hence by obeisance, my devotion hence,
And hence my transport.       Nor should this, perchance,
Pass unrecorded, that I still have lov'd
The exercise and produce of a toil
Than analytic industry to me
More pleasing, and whose character I deem
Is more poetic as resembling more
Creative agency. I mean to speak
Of that interminable building rear'd
By observation of affinities
In objects where no brotherhood exists
To common minds. My seventeenth year was come
And, whether from this habit, rooted now
So deeply in my mind, or from excess
Of the great social principle of life,
Coercing all things into sympathy,
To unorganic natures I transferr'd
My own enjoyments, or, the power of truth
Coming in revelation, I convers'd
With things that really are, I, at this time
Saw blessings spread around me like a sea.
Thus did my days pass on, and now at length
From Nature and her overflowing soul
I had receiv'd so much that all my thoughts
Were steep'd in feeling; I was only then
Contented when with bliss ineffable
I felt the sentiment of Being spread
O'er all that moves, and all that seemeth still,
O'er all, that, lost beyond the reach of thought
And human knowledge, to the human eye
Invisible, yet liveth to the heart,
O'er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings,
Or beats the gladsome air, o'er all that glides
Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself
And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not
If such my transports were; for in all things
I saw one life, and felt that it was joy.
One song they sang, and it was audible,
Most audible then when the fleshly ear,
O'ercome by grosser prelude of that strain,
Forgot its functions, and slept undisturb'd.
If this be error, and another faith
Find easier access to the pious mind,
Yet were I grossly destitute of all
Those human sentiments which make this earth
So dear, if I should fail, with grateful voice
To speak of you, Ye Mountains and Ye Lakes,
And sounding Cataracts! Ye Mists and Winds
That dwell among the hills where I was born.
If, in my youth, I have been pure in heart,
If, mingling with the world, I am content
With my own modest pleasures, and have liv'd,
With God and Nature communing, remov'd
From little enmities and low desires,
The gift is yours; if in these times of fear,
This melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown,
If, 'mid indifference and apathy
And wicked exultation, when good men,
On every side fall off we know not how,
To selfishness, disguis'd in gentle names
Of peace, and quiet, and domestic love,
Yet mingled, not unwillingly, with sneers
On visionary minds; if in this time
Of dereliction and dismay, I yet
Despair not of our nature; but retain
A more than Roman confidence, a faith
That fails not, in all sorrow my support,
The blessing of my life, the gift is yours,
Ye mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed
My lofty speculations; and in thee,
For this uneasy heart of ours I find
A never-failing principle of joy,
And purest passion.       Thou, my Friend! wert rear'd
In the great City, 'mid far other scenes;
But we, by different roads at length have gain'd
The self-same bourne. And for this cause to Thee
I speak, unapprehensive of contempt,
The insinuated scoff of coward tongues,
And all that silent language which so oft
In conversation betwixt man and man
Blots from the human countenance all trace
Of beauty and of love. For Thou hast sought
The truth in solitude, and Thou art one,
The most intense of Nature's worshippers
In many things my Brother, chiefly here
In this my deep devotion.       Fare Thee well!
Health, and the quiet of a healthful mind
Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men,
And yet more often living with Thyself,
And for Thyself, so haply shall thy days
Be many, and a blessing to mankind.

AFTER the Sea-Ship--after the whistling winds;
After the white-gray sails, taut to their spars and ropes,
Below, a myriad, myriad waves, hastening, lifting up their necks,
Tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship:
Waves of the ocean, bubbling and gurgling, blithely prying,
Waves, undulating waves--liquid, uneven, emulous waves,
Toward that whirling current, laughing and buoyant, with curves,
Where the great Vessel, sailing and tacking, displaced the surface;
Larger and smaller waves, in the spread of the ocean, yearnfully
flowing;
The wake of the Sea-Ship, after she passes--flashing and frolicsome,
under the sun,                                               10
A motley procession, with many a fleck of foam, and many fragments,
Following the stately and rapid Ship--in the wake following.

As night hath stars, more rare than ships
In ocean, faint from pole to pole,
So all the wonder of her lips
Hints her innavigable soul.
Such lights she gives as guide my barque;
But I am swallowed in the swell
Of her heart's ocean, sagely dark,
That holds my heaven and holds my hell.
In her I live, a mote minute
Dancing a moment in the sun:
In her I die, a sterile shoot
Of nightshade in oblivion.
In her my elf dissolves, a grain
Of salt cast careless in the sea;
My passion purifies my pain
To peace past personality.
Love of my life, God grant the years
Confirm the chrism - rose to rood!
Anointing loves, asperging tears
In sanctifying solitude!
Man is so infinitely small
In all these stars, determinate.
Maker and moulder of them all,
Man is so infinitely great!

A man came slowly from the setting sun,
To Emer, raddling raiment in her dun,
And said, "I am that swineherd whom you bid
Go watch the road between the wood and tide,
But now I have no need to watch it more."
Then Emer cast the web upon the floor,
And raising arms all raddled with the dye,
Parted her lips with a loud sudden cry.
That swineherd stared upon her face and said,
"No man alive, no man among the dead,
Has won the gold his cars of battle bring."
"But if your master comes home triumphing
Why must you blench and shake from foot to crown?"
Thereon he shook the more and cast him down
Upon the web-heaped floor, and cried his word:
"With him is one sweet-throated like a bird."
"You dare me to my face," and thereupon
She smote with raddled fist, and where her son
Herded the cattle came with stumbling feet,
And cried with angry voice, "It is not meet
To idle life away, a common herd."
"I have long waited, mother, for that word:
But wherefore now?"
"There is a man to die;
You have the heaviest arm under the sky."
"Whether under its daylight or its stars
My father stands amid his battle-cars."
"But you have grown to be the taller man."
"Yet somewhere under starlight or the sun
My father stands."
"Aged, worn out with wars
On foot. on horseback or in battle-cars."
"I only ask what way my journey lies,
For He who made you bitter made you wise."
"The Red Branch camp in a great company
Between wood's rim and the horses of the sea.
Go there, and light a camp-fire at wood's rim;
But tell your name and lineage to him
Whose blade compels, and wait till they have found
Some feasting man that the same oath has bound."
Among those feasting men Cuchulain dwelt,
And his young sweetheart close beside him knelt,
Stared on the mournful wonder of his eyes,
Even as Spring upon the ancient skies,
And pondered on the glory of his days;
And all around the harp-string told his praise,
And Conchubar, the Red Branch king of kings,
With his own fingers touched the brazen strings.
At last Cuchulain spake, "Some man has made
His evening fire amid the leafy shade.
I have often heard him singing to and fro,
I have often heard the sweet sound of his bow.
Seek out what man he is."
One went and came.
"He bade me let all know he gives his name
At the sword-point, and waits till we have found
Some feasting man that the same oath has bound."
Cuchulain cried, "I am the only man
Of all this host so bound from childhood on!"
After short fighting in the leafy shade,
He spake to the young man, 'Is there no maid
Who loves you, no white arms to wrap you round,
Or do you long for the dim sleepy ground,
That you have come and dared me to my face?"
"The dooms of men are in God's hidden place,"
"Your head a while seemed like a woman's head
That I loved once."
Again the fighting sped,
But now the war-rage in Cuchulain woke,
And through that new blade's guard the old blade broke,
And pierced him.
"Speak before your breath is done."
"Cuchulain I, mighty Cuchulain's son."
"I put you from your pain. I can no more."
While day its burden on to evening bore,
With head bowed on his knees Cuchulain stayed;
Then Conchubar sent that sweet-throated maid,
And she, to win him, his grey hair caressed;
In vain her arms, in vain her soft white breast.
Then Conchubar, the subtlest of all men,
Ranking his Druids round him ten by ten,
Spake thus: "Cuchulain will dwell there and brood
For three days more in dreadful quietude,
And then arise, and raving slay us all.
Chaunt in his ear delusions magical,
That he may fight the horses of the sea."
The Druids took them to their mystery,
And chaunted for three days.
Cuchulain stirred,
Stared on the horses of the sea, and heard
The cars of battle and his own name cried;
And fought with the invulnerable tide.

In the sea caves
there's a thirst there's a love
there's an ecstasy
all hard like shells
you can hold them in your palm.
In the sea caves
for whole days I gazed into your eyes
and I didn't know you nor did you know me.
Untitled poem drawn from the Book of Exercises. All translations by Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard

Under the light of the silver moon
We two sat, when our hearts were young;
The night was warm with the breath of June,
And loud from the meadow the cricket sung,
And darker and deeper, oh, love, than the sea,
Were your dear eyes, as they beamed to me.
The moon hung clear, and the night was still:
The waters reflected the glittering skies;
The nightingale sang on the distant hill;
But sweeter than all was the light in your eyes -
Your dear, dark eyes,  your eyes like the sea -
And up from the depths shone love for me.
My heart, like a river, was mad and wild -
And a river is not deep, like the sea;
But I said yout love was the love of a child,
Compared with the love that was felt by me;
A river leaps noisily, kissing the land,
But the sea is fathomless, deep and grand.
I vowed to love you, for ever and ever!
I called you cold, on that night in June,
But my fierce love, like a reckless river,
Dashed on, and away, and was spent too soon;
While yours - ah, yours was deep like the sea;
I cheated you, love, but you died for me!

Rose, harsh rose,
marred and with stint of petals,
meagre flower, thin,
sparse of leaf,
more precious
than a wet rose
single on a stem --
you are caught in the drift.
Stunted, with small leaf,
you are flung on the sand,
you are lifted
in the crisp sand
that drives in the wind.
Can the spice-rose
drip such acrid fragrance
hardened in a leaf?

It is a matter of a black cat
On a bare cliff top in March
Whose eyes anticipate
The gorse petals;
The formal equation of
A domestic purr
With the cold interiors
Of the sea's mirror.

Where are your monuments, your battles, martyrs?
Where is your tribal memory? Sirs,
in that gray vault. The sea. The sea
has locked them up. The sea is History.
First, there was the heaving oil,
heavy as chaos;
then, likea light at the end of a tunnel,
the lantern of a caravel,
and that was Genesis.
Then there were the packed cries,
the shit, the moaning:
Exodus.
Bone soldered by coral to bone,
mosaics
mantled by the benediction of the shark's shadow,
that was the Ark of the Covenant.
Then came from the plucked wires
of sunlight on the sea floor
the plangent harp of the Babylonian bondage,
as the white cowries clustered like manacles
on the drowned women,
and those were the ivory bracelets
of the Song of Solomon,
but the ocean kept turning blank pages
looking for History.
Then came the men with eyes heavy as anchors
who sank without tombs,
brigands who barbecued cattle,
leaving their charred ribs like palm leaves on the shore,
then the foaming, rabid maw
of the tidal wave swallowing Port Royal,
and that was Jonah,
but where is your Renaissance?
Sir, it is locked in them sea sands
out there past the reef's moiling shelf,
where the men-o'-war floated down;
strop on these goggles, I'll guide you there myself.
It's all subtle and submarine,
through colonnades of coral,
past the gothic windows of sea fans
to where the crusty grouper, onyx-eyed,
blinks, weighted by its jewels, like a bald queen;
and these groined caves with barnacles
pitted like stone
are our cathedrals,
and the furnace before the hurricanes:
Gomorrah. Bones ground by windmills
into marl and cornmeal,
and that was Lamentations -
that was just Lamentations,
it was not History;
then came, like scum on the river's drying lip,
the brown reeds of villages
mantling and congealing into towns,
and at evening, the midges' choirs,
and above them, the spires
lancing the side of God
as His son set, and that was the New Testament.
Then came the white sisters clapping
to the waves' progress,
and that was Emancipation -
jubilation, O jubilation -
vanishing swiftly
as the sea's lace dries in the sun,
but that was not History,
that was only faith,
and then each rock broke into its own nation;
then came the synod of flies,
then came the secretarial heron,
then came the bullfrog bellowing for a vote,
fireflies with bright ideas
and bats like jetting ambassadors
and the mantis, like khaki police,
and the furred caterpillars of judges
examining each case closely,
and then in the dark ears of ferns
and in the salt chuckle of rocks
with their sea pools, there was the sound
like a rumour without any echo
of History, really beginning.

The sea awoke at midnight from its sleep,
And round the pebbly beaches far and wide
I heard the first wave of the rising tide
Rush onward with uninterrupted sweep;
A voice out of the silence of the deep,
A sound mysteriously multiplied
As of a cataract from the mountain's side,
Or roar of winds upon a wooded steep.
So comes to us at times, from the unknown
And inaccessible solitudes of being,
The rushing of the sea-tides of the soul;
And inspirations, that we deem our own,
Are some divine of foreshadowing and foreseeing
Of things beyond our reason or control.

The postman comes when I am still in bed.
"Postman, what do you have for me today?"
I say to him. (But really I'm in bed.)
Then he says - what shall I have him say?
"This letter says that you are president
Of - this word here; it's a republic."
Tell them I can't answer right away.
"It's your duty." No, I'd rather just be sick.
Then he tells me there are letters saying everything
That I can think of that I want for them to say.
I say, "Well, thank you very much. Good-bye."
He is ashamed, and turns and walks away.
If I can think of it, it isn't what I want.
I want . . . I want a ship from some near star
To land in the yard, and beings to come out
And think to me: "So this is where you are!
Come." Except that they won't do,
I thought of them. . . . And yet somewhere there must be
Something that's different from everything.
All that I've never thought of - think of me!

wearing a short hair
a smile
her hands clasped
she sits beside her
sick grandmother
the faint light
by the window
enters gently
filtered by the
thin silky drape
the grandmother
is dying and her
daughter has an
axe to grind
she comes as
an offering
a link between
two worlds
long separated
by indifference.

Im sick of crying,
Im sick of lying,
Im sick of trying for something that wouldnt even work.
I hate thinking about you
I hate thinking its all true
I hate thinking about the past because your just a jerk.

O, Noorjahan, thou know’st,
I have been sick all these days?
‘Justice, O Queen, on this brutal sinner,
Who tortured the world?
The river Jamuna was reddened
And run thinner every day.
Now see, I being sick,
Destined to be howled in the next world.
I, for myself, pained other’s heart,
The shame must be borne alone,
Bows my head and trembles my knees.
I am a kefir, vexed others, and cursed by God.
.O, Noorjahan, thou young, I old,
Sad he who lives here, on silk carpets,
All kind of fruits, grape syrup, apple, colored ice,
Cherries served in diamond plates,
I have meat, wine and virgins at will,
And palaces of treasure, nor enjoy these.
As my body and soul, both sick.
Crippled with deficiency syndrome,
Unknown are my real father and mother,
Borne by the magic of a fakir,
And one among thirty usurp wives and,
Five thousand concubines may be my mother.
Grey bearded corrupt courtiers never wrote,
Misdeeds my father did, nor the thousands did he slay,
He loved brutalities and lived long,
Cursed my childhood, with the cold, dull soil.
Youth blackened with follies and ill thoughts,
Doomed, absurd and arrogant.
Even the mighty name, I have,
Will soon be forgotten, when I am dead,
So have I neither fame nor joy.
Death’s harsh brush, dimmed thy cruel brow,
A life that wrote havoc with the sword,
Power made it imbecile.
Molded itself in wine, women and wealth
A life with vigor dimmed and decayed,
Now chocked, my faltering soul and tongue,
A brutal heart not to be wrecked by countless dead,
Will be buried under fretted stones’ tomb,
In a dark corner of Agra.
From:
DR. Yogesh SHARMA

Numb, stiff, broken by no sleep,
I keep night watch. Looking for
signs to quiet fear, I creep
closer to his bed and hear
his breath come and go, holding
my own as if my own were
all I paid. Nothing I bring,
say, or do has meaning here.
Outside, ice crusts on river
and pond; wild hare come to my
door pacified by torture.
No less ignorant than they
of what grips and why, I am
moved to prayer, the quaint gestures
which ennoble beyond shame
only the mute listener.
No one hears. A dry wind shifts
dry snow, indifferently;
the roof, rotting beneath drifts,
sighs and holds. Terrified by
sleep, the child strives toward
consciousness and the known pain.
If it were mine by one word
I would not save any man,
myself or the universe
at such cost: reality.
Heir to an ancestral curse
though fallen from Judah's tree,
I take up into my arms my hopes,
my son, for what it's worth give
bodily warmth. When he escapes
his heritage, then what have
I left but false remembrance
and the name? Against that day
there is no armor or stance,
only the frail dignity
of surrender, which is all
that can separate me now
or then from the dumb beast's fall,
unseen in the frozen snow.

There is nothing that says
People have to prove they have no clue
As to what they are doing.
There is nothing to get them jailed,
For playing the roll of idiot overtime.
How they land in positions of decision making,
Should break all of our hearts.
Surrealistic 'realities' are becoming the norm!
Freaks, geeks and weirdness has become mainstream.
Children can now download porno on a phone that buzzes...
Or rings,
Or plays loud music that makes some want to scream!
And some old man sitting alone in a convalescent home,
Staring out the window...
Will declare these years we now live as the good years,
When flashbacking to these times!
Glorifying the days of corruption,
And imitating how he too dealt with crime!
And today...
This circus has some folks,
Justifying this 'crap' in their minds!
Playing truth or dare,
With a peace no one can find!
But every dime is being sucked up...
In search for ways to make it happen!
There is nothing that says
People have to prove they have no clue,
As to what they are doing...
When something they do,
Is screwing it up for me and you!
But there should be a limit placed
On the number of psychiatrists,
Who are hired as policemen...
To maintain a law and order,
That has clearly become a nightmare
Wherever sick judgements are made!

the further I sweep it under the rug,
the more this cancer builds walls inside-out.
the more I fear myself, or starve myself of
essential self-appreciation, or cringe, or
drive blindly through the rising twisting roads,
the more the grease collects. the puddle of
grease and sweat too big to step around.
the less I check and balance, and the more
I deny or delay or forget, the deeper I sink,
which equates incompetence. which means
failure. failure ensures low moods
and low moods ensure a cold blanket of loneliness.
the taller the tree becomes in his journey to the sky,
the more ambition I lose to conquer him
and get there first.
the urge fades and I decline dangerously.
the more I dropp anchor or wear masks,
or stubbornly decide not to pick up the phone
or leave the house,
the longer I'll stay where nobody is.
the worse my beautiful original features seem.
the more I'll feel neglected.
more and more, I'll be killing myself.
the more I follow advice and the arrows,
the less independent I become.
dependence ensures cling and cling leads to conflict.
the more I pray, the better. I'll start feeling better
if I dust off the past and ride on the crest of progress.
the more dreams I have of you,
the less I trust myself to stand up in confidence
while I grow more needy. more tragically dismal.
more accustomed to panic as I strive hopelessly
to accept and comprehend and live with
and sit still around the fact
that you can't always be near me.

Stella is sick, and in that sickbed lies
Sweetness, which breathes and pants as oft as she:
And Grace, sick too, such fine conclusions tries
That Sickness brags itself best grac'd to be.
Beauty is sick, but sick in so fair guise
That is that paleness Beauty's white we see,
And Joy, which is inseparate from those eyes,
Stella now learns (strange case) to weep in thee.
Love moves thy pain, and like a faithful page,
As thy looks stir, runs up and down to make
All folks press'd at thy will thy pain t'assuage.
Nature with care sweats for her darling's sake,
Knowing worlds pass, ere she enough can find
Of such heav'n stuff, to clothe so heav'nly mind.

The sick wind moans, moans the sick wind
There mystery lies in its every moan:
It tells all and nothing yet it tells
How careful hides it the secret in its breast.
The old oak hears the sick wind
And hearing it understands its own
And weeps the old oak without a cry.

It's very hard to pronounce and the prince's name is Legerdemain.
His patchy wallet contains a picture of Madonna and full of rubbish.
He is not a cherub it seems.
The scars of his wrist a handiwork like tattoos of different handcuffs he wore.
His Pidgin English and the moisten heart
Does somebody could understand?
Then he will be surprised.
He is a pickpocket and one day he found his deceased mother's photo
In a stolen wallet and he said goodbye to his sorrowful career.

The new trend is misery
The new look, reeks of despair...
The life-size Barbie doll
Her hair, now inky black
She shares her pain
Yes, she tells her story.
In all her madness
In all her ridiculous
Beautiful
Mad, fucked-up glory!
And, the people believe it.
They buy it, rather quick
Her mystique becomes the major seller
She is their topmost pick!
They, scream: "screw 'em all! "
"Hell, screw the rest! "
And, they buy her a dollhouse
In a neighborhood for the best.
Sunset Boulevard—
The best of the worst
And, they wrap her in satin
And, they rent her a Hearse.
Premature death, for this Queen
In such an arduous, persistent pain—
They knew just what they were doing;
They mastered this whole game!
They sold their souls
They did it, in vain
They peaked and heightened
Because, they'd paid for their fame!
They walked the streets
As we screamed their names!
They had taken all—
In the illuminati game!
And, now bored with their own lives
They crave to feel her pain
They have nothing that is real
She has nothing but her fame!
Hang her face—
On your wall
All her pain
The teardrops, they fall...
"She is stylish!
She breathes hate! "—
They bid, and they shout!
They scream prices!
They debate!
"Those tears are worth one million! "
"That pain is worth ten more! "
"And, why, I'd pay anything that they were asking! —
to capture the pained look on the face of that whore! "
Eventually,
She'll be removed from the wall
And, her face will be shoved—
In some overstuffed closet, down the hall.
When she becomes aged news—
When her face, it becomes rather lame
When they seek a new victim and archetype—
Another lost soul to play their game!

Just look at that sweet thang
wearing that tight silver wrap!
At a table nearby, he sat, inhaling
and exhaling smoke rings
eyes sparing not a minute
off that sweet southern bell.
yet keeping
not his desire tightly
under his cap, or his
dazzling red eyes off her
bell-shape bottom, and
salavating like pavlo's dog.
He grabs and held her tight!
Peeled off her shiny wrap-
completely exposing her milk
chocolate body.
Extending his trembling hands
to meet her offer, beads of moisture rising
like the morning dew, cooling his forehead.
The hard-eating chocoholic
grabbed silver-bell off the table,
tossed It into his waiting mouth,
circled it with his tongue, the
milk chocolate flowing down his chin
He smacked his lips in delight...:
"I'LL NEVER EAT ANOTHER CHOCOLATE KISS"

Silver Cup!
In the land of your muse;
Life!
With the coastal muse of your love.
Pink, link!
To the Pink Prison;
In the land of your muse,
But, handle me with care.
Life!
Learning the truth after 50 years;
Broadly! !
Widely,
But, being very much in love with you.

Silver mid- night moon

Oh! Her touch a boon!

The goddess of white silver
On long slabs of stones
Reflection of light
From the river
Richness of green and grey
With earthen sensuality
1/2/2010
Islamabad

I bought a pair of silver sneakers
So I could run on God's golden road.
The laces were spun of shinny silver thread
And tipped with the purest of purest gold.
I could run faster than the speed of light
Everytime I placed them on my feet.
The feeling they gave me when I ran
Was a feeling noting could ever beat.
I joined in running Heaven's marathon
With my number placed on my back and chest.
To be viewed by all God's Angel's
Cheering me on to finish my spiritual quest.
I worked so hard to get to see this day
The one where I could run on God's golden streets.
And to hear the Angel's playing Heavenly music
While wearing those silver sneakers upon
My now Angelic feet.

Well,—it was two days after my husband died—
Two days!  And the earth still raw above him.
And I was sweeping the carpet in their hall.
In number four—the room with the red wall-paper—
Some chorus girls and men were singing that song
'They'll soon be lighting candles
Round a box with silver handles'—and hearing them sing it
I started to cry.  Just then he came along
And stopped on the stairs and turned and looked at me,
And took the cigar from his mouth and sort of smiled
And said, 'Say, what's the matter?' and then came down
Where I was leaning against the wall,
And touched my shoulder, and put his arm around me . . .
And I was so sad, thinking about it,—
Thinking that it was raining, and a cold night,
With Jim so unaccustomed to being dead,—
That I was happy to have him sympathize,
To feel his arm, and leaned against him and cried.
And before I knew it, he got me into a room
Where a table was set, and no one there,
And sat me down on a sofa, and held me close,
And talked to me, telling me not to cry,
That it was all right, he'd look after me,—
But not to cry, my eyes were getting red,
Which didn't make me pretty.  And he was so nice,
That when he turned my face between his hands,
And looked at me, with those blue eyes of his,
And smiled, and leaned, and kissed me—
Somehow I couldn't tell him not to do it,
Somehow I didn't mind, I let him kiss me,
And closed my eyes! . . . Well, that was how it started.
For when my heart was eased with crying, and grief
Had passed and left me quiet, somehow it seemed
As if it wasn't honest to change my mind,
To send him away, or say I hadn't meant it—
And, anyway, it seemed so hard to explain!
And so we sat and talked, not talking much,
But meaning as much in silence as in words,
There in that empty room with palms about us,
That private dining-room . . . And as we sat there
I felt my future changing, day by day,
With unknown streets opening left and right,
New streets with farther lights, new taller houses,
Doors swinging into hallways filled with light,
Half-opened luminous windows, with white curtains
Streaming out in the night, and sudden music,—
And thinking of this, and through it half remembering
A quick and horrible death, my husband's eyes,
The broken-plastered walls, my boy asleep,—
It seemed as if my brain would break in two.
My voice began to tremble . . . and when I stood,
And told him I must go, and said good-night—
I couldn't see the end.  How would it end?
Would he return to-morrow?  Or would he not?
And did I want him to—or would I rather
Look for another job?—He took my shoulders
Between his hands, and looked down into my eyes,
And smiled, and said good-night.  If he had kissed me,
That would have—well, I don't know; but he didn't . .
And so I went downstairs, then, half elated,
Hoping to close the door before that party
In number four should sing that song again—
'They'll soon be lighting candles round a box with silver handles'—
And sure enough, I did.  I faced the darkness.
And my eyes were filled with tears.  And I was happy.

The silver swan, who living had no note,
When death approach'd, unlock'd her silent throat;
Leaning her breast against the reedy shore,
Thus sung her first and last, and sung no more.
Farewell, all joys; O Death, come close mine eyes;
More geese than swans now live, more fools than wise.

Go, go, my naughty girl, and kiss
Your little sister dear;
I must not have such things as this,
And noisy quarrels here.
What! little children scratch and fight,
That ought to be so mild;
Oh! Mary, it's a shocking sight
To see an angry child.
I can't imagine, for my part,
The reason for your folly;
She did not do you any hurt
By playing with your dolly.
See, see, the little tears that run
Fast from her watery eye:
Come, my sweet innocent, have done,
'Twill do no good to cry.
Go, Mary, wipe her tears away,
And make it up with kisses:
And never turn a pretty play
To such a pet as this is.

You tell me that you need to know
how I truly feel
How can I possibly tell you that
when I don't even know whats real
Ever since I was a little child
I've been tough only to hide
All of my emotions
everything inside
You tell me you tried so damn hard
to help me break down my walls
But all I did was shield away
and build them up real tall
Inside I search for someone who really cares
the person that comes to mind is you
I feel alone
because you ask me 'you are, who? '
I gaev up on love and feelings
a long time ago
That is why my life is now
just a show
Sorry I say, sister mine
I want to give you everything left
But my voice has died
and you are deaf
I love you,
I want you to know
That if when I leave this world
I care for you deep inside, that's why I had to go.
Remember sis that the dream lives on
As bright as a star in the sky, you have always shone.
(to my sis....you probably will never read this....if you do...I love you...I always did....I'm sorry if i didn't show it....you where always the only one who cared...thank you for everything...<3)

I’m ever so numb
So why cant you see
That not only do I not but now I hate my family
You took what made me smile
Now I cry all the time not just once and a while
Know I am numb and can not feel
Please tell me what is the deal
You have to learn to trust the girl that you raised
Just let us be friends and you will be amazed
Amazed to see the smile brake away that frozen frown
its not like ill be a stripper in town
I use to tell you everything and anything
Now I just wait for the phone to ring
We use to be so close not to mention
But now at dinner you can just feel the tension
Daddy just understand that with out you I can live
You have given all the help you can give
You have taken my light and burned it out
You have taken my heart and made it cold
You have taken my sister and hurt me so
I cant talk to you with out being judged
But now I can see that you decision can not be budged
If I could I would walk till my feet were nothing but a blister
Dad.. I don’t need a therapist I need my big sister! !

I dedicate this poem to my sister.  who I love so much.
My Dear Sister
You may fall but I have your back
You may forget, but your schedule I have on track
You may forget me, but I won’t you
You may not remember what to do
But in this fight we’ll walk side by side
But whenever you need I’ll give you a ride
My Dear Sister
Do not fret
I’ll be the very best friend you’ve ever met
My dear sister when you are in need
The very words you say I will take heed
My Dear Sister
I love you so much
When your spirit wounded my shoulder is you crutch

My sister holds me tight
My sister kisses me goodnight
My sister knows when I’m mad
My sister helps me when I’m sad
My sister is so smart
My sister has my heart
My sister loves me lots
My sister ties the knots
My sister is here to stay
My sister I have until this very day
My sister I wish you well
My sister yes I can tell
My sister asked if I lied
My sister knows if I’ve cried
My sister has moved away
My sister is in my heart to and will always stay

The anticipation grows each day
To see my little sister appear and say
Carolyn I love you so
Thankyou for being the sister I know
I talk some days to my mums tiny bump
And see this huge explosive thump
Is this my sister already talking to me?
i really hope so I guess ill soon see
all the love and care inside
builds each day it can not hide
it is all made for this one little girl
my first sister to be my mums little pearl
in a few weeks ill no longer be
this “only child”, its no longer just me
this is definitely not a bad thing
I already love my unborn sibling
When she appears we will all celebrate
Me, mum and Jase we really cant wait
To see her little face awaken  and shine
This really will be a happy time
So to you my little unborn sibling
After 17 years I now know what I have been missing
A little sister to love and hold near
And that baby girl is you my dear

Sister-in-law has got special position
All liberties but close relation out of question
So much praise showered on her with special mention
Husband praises  without any hesitation
She stands as half wife for full wife
Vacancy is filled when situation is rife
Not to worry for any good flirt
Wife has to remain quiet but always alert,
No sweet but good and colourful relation,
Happy moments and adding to elations,
No tension and worry when she is around,
You can have  easy walk on slippery ground
Husbands take pride in having in law
Don’t find fault or any other flaw
Always ready and anxious to  care
Prefer all relation but to be seen no where
Wives too happy and share lenient views
Allows no  freedom which is undue
After all, in law is her real sister
Above all, husband is her real mister
So long not married, everything goes well
After her departure, it turns into hell
No one is prepared for stories to tell
It was only phase not much to dwell
Even kids may prefer in law to mother
Not even look in home even at father
This doesn’t drive them crazy any more
No one takes note and stress or bother
This is delicate relation and bound to suffer
Many ups and downs with stories to offer
Many may argue with difference of opinion
After al it is sister-in- law and not the companion

God gave her beauteous body and long hair!
Intelligent, she prayed really hard;
She spoke fluently and looked very fair;
As doctor, she was superb in the ward.
But suddenly, her dad had fallen ill;
She looked after him ‘like a nurse’ by day;
‘Insulined’ making urine sugar ‘Nil’!
She worked as doctor by night far away!
God bless’d her with good husband, three children;
Her Practice too is good but life is tough;
She tends to mother more than eighty when
She develops chest-cold and nasty cough.
God bless my doctor sister for her feat!
Help her in times of woes: devils defeat.

Im sorry for all the mean things I said
Im sorry for ever time I yelled at you.
Im sorry for leaving the house when Im mad.
Im sorry for not being there for you.
You shuldent be the one thats sick.
If I could, Id take away all the pain.
All the Meds, and the Doctors visits.
If I had the choice, I would rather be sick.
You have all your life to live
And all the time left.
You dont deserve this
No one does.
To my little sister,
Im sorry
And
I love you.

We’ve been in the rain so long
That our eyes are sore and red;
When joy is missing,
We gaze down too long at our feet
As we slowly walk through the city,
But there must be a different sky waiting
Offering love and inspiration.
Beneath these yellow factory skies,
Even the street lights look sadly dim,
Like our spiritual light within
Blurred by an affectionless life.
Things began to change
When I met you in a small bar
Not far from the school where you teach;
I saw Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass
Easing out of your purse,
I knew we had to talk.
As we spoke over drinks
In the early evening,
I felt loneliness begin to lift
Like dark persistent clouds
Being pushed aside by sunlight,
As if Walt Whitman were sending us
Prayers mingled with lilacs.
Indeed, there is a different sky waiting,
Azure blue and dazzling,
Inviting flowers to bloom
On romantic avenues
When two people finally find each other.
In my mind I have already seen
You smile in a summer dress
Beneath a different sky welcoming our love.

Birdy, birdy in the sky
Why you do that in my eye
I thought you were my friend so true
Now I can't see, my eye's like glue!

Like fire in the sky it is
When the sun sets in the night
Red and yellow engulf the world
In a vivid and glorious sight
It’s seems so unexplainable
How the sky lights up this way
I can’t think of a more perfect
Way to end the day
Sometimes purple adds itself
To the colors up above
A fever in the sky it seems
Or God showing His thoughtful love
Whatever is the reason
We enjoy the sights so much
When the sun drops from the sky
And leaves its brilliant touch!

The sky is crumbling into millions of paper dots
the wind blows in my face
so I duck into my favorite barber shop
and listen to Vivaldi and look in the mirror
reflecting the shopfront windows, Broadway
and 104th, and watch the dots blown by the wind
blow into the faces of the walkers outside
& here comes a thin old man swaddled in scarves,
he must be seventy-five, walking slowly,
and in his mind there is a young man dancing,
maybe seventeen years old, on a June evening --
he is that young man, I can tell, watching him walk

When thunderstorms come out to play,
And lightning o'er this earth is seen,
Dense clouds descend in colours grey,
And rain pours forth, where sun has been.
When crescendos resound in humid air,
And exacerbate our troubled sky,
Will all the power residing there,
Look kindly down from portals high.
Such danger lurks in flashes bright,
Splitting the heavens so mercilessly,
But what an amazing glorious sight,
Portrayed here in all its ferocity.

Sky, blue sky
so blue and shy
u only appear
when there are clouds to dissapear
then comes the sun
so worm as the love of a mum
the sky full of light
iluminated by life
sometimes blue and and grey
how he should stay?
maybe always blue
maybe always gray
who knows
someday there will be no sky
to think how he shoul stay...

The flower of the Alps told the seashell: "You're shining"
The seashell told the sea: "You echo"
The sea told the boat: "You're shuddering"
The boat told the fire: "You're glowing brightly"
The fire told me: "I glow less brightly than her eyes"
The boat told me: "I shudder less than your heart does when she appears"
The sea told me: "I echo less than her name does in your love-making"
The seashell told me: "I shine less brightly than the phosphorus of desire in your hollow dream"
The flower of the Alps told me: "She's beautiful"
I said: "She's beautiful, so beautiful, she moves me."

Some activity with an addicting done,
Had to purposely afflict them to accept...
Misguided beliefs to condone and not shun,
To keep in their minds with such effectiveness.
To bring them to quickly re-act,
Without a thought process useless.
As if they had none.
'The sky is falling.
The sky is falling! '
~WHERE? WHERE? ~
'Over there.
Can't you see it? '
~I could 'if' I chose to.
But...
Do you mind me asking you this? ~
'NO! Go ahead.
What-what-WHAT?
Hurry up.'
~If the sky is falling over there.
WHY do you rush to get under it?
When the sky is perfectly clear right here? ~
'You?
You're one of those 'nonconformists' aren't you?
EVERYONE! EVERYONE!
Hear me now.
Hear me now.
The sky is falling.
The sky is falling!
We must run to get under it.
Come 'everyone. Come.'
Some activity with an addicting done,
Had to purposely guide them to accept...
Misguided beliefs to condone and not shun,
To keep in their minds with such effectiveness.
To bring them to quickly re-act,
Without a thought process intact...
To examine and enact with facts attached.

Soon I’ll be transported to the sky, to be with my Lord way up high.
I will be lifted up into the clouds, to join the many victorious crowds.
And together we’ll see the face, of Christ who led us by His Grace.
On that day and that special hour, we’ll be changed by His Power.
Friend, this is what’s ahead for me, and all on their way to Eternity.
This is the Hope I have in Christ, which goes beyond temporal life,
He’s gone to prepare a place for us, and in His words I put my trust.
Christ’s coming back again for me, so that where He is I too can be.
We do not know what lies ahead, but, we know what Christ had said.
So be not anxious my dear friend, for this life on earth is not the end.
Soon will come great devastation; for all waiting He brings Salvation.
Jesus is our Blessed Hope my friend; He’s a brighter path to the end.
In Christ we’re on a different path; we weren’t saved to suffer wrath,
Saved by Christ’s Gracious Love, to live with Him forever up above.
When we hear that trumpet sound, all the Saints shall gather round,
Jesus Christ the Eternal King, and together hear the Heavens sing.
My friend, in the twinkling of an eye, we’ll be with The Lord on high,
Changed to be just like The Lord, with new bodies that will endure,
Eternity with our Lord Jesus Christ, as He leads us into Eternal Life.
So friend it’s right to keep our eyes, fixed upon our Lord in the skies.

Preparing for sleep
heedless of my clothing just
undressing the day.

SISTER Simplicitie,
Sing, sing a song to me,
Sing me to sleep.
Some legend low and long,
Slow as the summer song
Of the dull Deep.
Some legend long and low,
Whose equal ebb and flow
To and fro creep
On the dim marge of gray
’Tween the soul’s night and day,
Washing “awake” away
Into “asleep.”
Some legend low and long,
Never so weak or strong
As to let go
While it can hold this heart
Withouten sigh or smart,
Or as to hold this heart
When it sighs “No.”
Some long low swaying song,
As the sway’d shadow long
Sways to and fro
Where, thro’ the crowing cocks,
And by the swinging clocks,
Some weary mother rocks
Some weary woe.
Sing up and down to me
Like a dream-boat at sea,
So, and still so,
Float through the “then” and “when,”
Rising from when to then,
Sinking from then to when
While the waves go.
Low and high, high and low,
Now and then, then and now,
Mow, now;
And when the now is then, and when the then is now,
And when the low is high, and when the high is low,
Low, low;
Let me float, let the boat
Go, go;
Let me glide, let me slide
Slow, slow;
Gliding boat, sliding boat,
Slow, slow;
Glide away, slide away
So, so.

I sleep a lot and read St. Thomas Aquinas
Or The Death of God (that's a Protestant book).
To the right the bay as if molten tin,
Beyond the bay, city, beyond the city, ocean,
Beyond the ocean, ocean, till Japan.
To the left dry hills with white grass,
Beyond the hills an irrigated valley where rice is grown,
Beyond the valley, mountains and Ponderosa pines,
Beyond the mountains, desert and sheep.
When I couldn't do without alcohol, I drove myself on alcohol,
When I couldn't do without cigarettes and coffee, I drove myself
On cigarettes and coffee.
I was courageous. Industrious. Nearly a model of virtue.
But that is good for nothing.
I feel a pain.
not here. Even I don't know.
many islands and continents,
words, bazaars, wooden flutes,
Or too much drinking to the mirror, without beauty,
Though one was to be a kind of archangel
Or a Saint George, over there, on St. George Street.
Please, Doctor,
Not here. No,
Maybe it's too
Unpronounced
Please, Medicine Man, I feel a pain.
I always believed in spells and incantations.
Sure, women have only one, Catholic, soul,
But we have two. When you start to dance
You visit remote pueblos in your sleep
And even lands you have never seen.
Put on, I beg you, charms made of feathers,
Now it's time to help one of your own.
I have read many books but I don't believe them.
When it hurts we return to the banks of certain rivers.
I remember those crosses with chiseled suns and moons
And wizards, how they worked during an outbreak of typhus.
Send your second soul beyond the mountains, beyond time.
Tell me what you saw, I will wait.

She fell asleep on Christmas Eve:
At length the long-ungranted shade
Of weary eyelids overweigh'd
The pain nought else might yet relieve.
Our mother, who had lean'd all day
Over the bed from chime to chime,
Then rais'd herself for the first time,
And as she sat her down, did pray.
Her little work-table was spread
With work to finish. For the glare
Made by her candle, she had care
To work some distance from the bed.
Without, there was a cold moon up,
Of winter radiance sheer and thin;
The hollow halo it was in
Was like an icy crystal cup.
Through the small room, with subtle sound
Of flame, by vents the fireshine drove
And redden'd. In its dim alcove
The mirror shed a clearness round.
I had been sitting up some nights,
And my tired mind felt weak and blank;
Like a sharp strengthening wine it drank
The stillness and the broken lights.
Twelve struck. That sound, by dwindling years
Heard in each hour, crept off; and then
The ruffled silence spread again,
Like water that a pebble stirs.
Our mother rose from where she sat:
Her needles, as she laid them down,
Met lightly, and her silken gown
Settled: no other noise than that.
"Glory unto the Newly Born!"
So, as said angels, she did say;
Because we were in Christmas Day,
Though it would still be long till morn.
Just then in the room over us
There was a pushing back of chairs,
As some who had sat unawares
So late, now heard the hour, and rose.
With anxious softly-stepping haste
Our mother went where Margaret lay,
Fearing the sounds o'erhead--should they
Have broken her long watch'd-for rest!
She stoop'd an instant, calm, and turn'd;
But suddenly turn'd back again;
And all her features seem'd in pain
With woe, and her eyes gaz'd and yearn'd.
For my part, I but hid my face,
And held my breath, and spoke no word:
There was none spoken; but I heard
The silence for a little space.
Our mother bow'd herself and wept:
And both my arms fell, and I said,
"God knows I knew that she was dead."
And there, all white, my sister slept.
Then kneeling, upon Christmas morn
A little after twelve o'clock
We said, ere the first quarter struck,
"Christ's blessing on the newly born!"

I watch you, as you sleep,
the glow, a rosy hue
of Roman cheeks,
a tiny trickle, as if glued
onto the crease of lips
so red and so inviting,
your hands asleep
in what they call the warmest spot
of living humans,
I wish I could,
and surely would.
I am your guard tonight,
just sitting here,
prepared to be the death
of horny demons,
should they forget their place
and wander in.
I have now put the final cork away,
and opened up the kitchen clock
to rip the living battery
and put an end to it,
the pulse of time.
I shall be happy just to sit
here, by your side,
and dream about the warmth
of you, in all those feather downs.
For Angie

I bless the power of this charmed summer night,
I bless its magic and its mystery,
Which in ecstatic visions brings to me
The worshiped presence of my soul's delight.
Mine eyes are sealed, but on my clearer sight
Her heaven-bright features shine more radiantly,
Her sweet voice with a richer melody
Enchants the dark, more luminous than light.
I miss the sense of daylight's haunting ills,
Bathed in this lambent tide of sleep and love;
I only see one dazzling image beam,
Shrined in a rosy universe of dream,
Fairer than Dian bending tranced above
The sleeping shepherd on the Latmian hills.

Sleep, sleep, my sweet  one sleep
Let the film of Morpheus come
Like a veiled mist
And visit your eye-lids
And in the airs around
Invisible a sweet sylph sings
A lulling lullaby.
Sleep, sleep, my sweet one sleep
And woes forget and ills
And wrongs and plots
And treacheries:
Like a veiled mist
Dreams are falling through
Falling
Falling
Falling thro’ your eye-lids thick
With the lead of Morpheus awhile
A sylph doth sing
A lulling lullaby.
Sleep, sleep, my sweet one sleep
And think of day and night
And dusk and dawn
And even
As one film images pass
Along your eyes a-dreaming
a-dreaming
A-dreaming
Awhile< br>A sylph doth sing
A lulling lullaby.

All night the cocks crew, under a moon like day,
And I, in the cage of sleep, on a stranger's breast,
Shed tears, like a task not to be put away---
In the false light, false grief in my happy bed,
A labor of tears, set against joy's undoing.
I would not wake at your word, I had tears to say.
I clung to the bars of the dream and they were said,
And pain's derisive hand had given me rest
From the night giving off flames, and the dark renewing.

MEASURE me out from the fathomless tun
That somewhere or other you keep
In your vasty cellars, O wealthy one,
Twenty gallons of sleep.
Twenty gallons of balmy sleep,
Dreamless, and deep, and mild,
Of the excellent brand you used to keep
When I was a little child.
I’ve tasted of all your vaunted stock,
Your clarets and ports of Spain,
The liquid gold of your famous hock,
And your matchless dry champagne.
Of your rich muscats and your sherries fine,
I’ve drunk both well and deep;
Then measure me out, O merchant mine,
Twenty gallons of sleep.
Twenty gallons of slumber soft,
Of the innocent, baby kind,
When the angels flutter their wings aloft
And the pillow with down is lined.
I have drawn the corks, and drained the lees,
Of every vintage pressed;
If I’ve felt the sting of my honey bees,
I’ve taken it with the rest.
I have lived my life, and I’ll not repine;
As I sowed I was bound to reap;
Then measure me out, O merchant mine,
Twenty gallons of sleep.

a snake is bitten by another snake
it is bleeding and leaves and looks for a tree
to take some sap
for its own cure,
a boy sees what the snake is doing
waits and when the snake leaves
the boy bites the tree
to take the sap
the boy is cured of its long sickness
the tree had long been there near him
but it is the snake that points to him
the tree that can cure his own malady.

The snake charmer playing the wooden ' been' instrument
And the cobras,
Hooded and hissing
Dancing,
Dancing and swaying to the tunes,
To the tunes melodious,
Oh, captivated and charmed
By the haunting music of the East
Swaying beautifully
And dangerously,
The beastly and brute reptiles of the woods
So much so frightening,
Dreadful and deadly
And venomous
And full of fangs.
The turbaned charmer, clad in a white dhoti and kurta,
Somewhat clumsy and soiled
And with the bamboo baskets
Hanging by the bamboo,
Balanced at endways
Through a rope,
Approaching to show
The spectacle
And the folk gathering,
Singing a song so submissively
And praying to  Naga-Devata,
Ma Manasha and Ma Shitala,
Telling of Bihula and Lakhinder
And when with the show to start,
He touching the basket,
Shaking and half-opening it
And the cobras coming out,
Creeping out,
Standing on,
Hooded and hissing
And he playing with the hand
And the cap of the basket
And playing the been,
Taking it the head of the cobras,
Blackly, brownish and whitish
And the cobras listening to
And swaying
Under the spell of the haunting music
Of the East,
Standing charmed and captivated by,
Under the spell of music.

Into the snake's eyes I looked deeply within
I saw not hate or evil or any deadly sin
I saw fear and terror from a creature that wanted to survive
And all that it wanted to do was just to stay alive
It curled itself around my arm as though ready to fight
But did it do it out of anger or did it do it out of fright
As the snake has been cursed since the beginning of time
Because of a deed of its relative and its father's past crime
Since that day the snake has been killed and cursed
Evils and sins of the snake we all have been immersed
So once again I looked into that snakes deadly eyes
I still couldn't see sin or evil or even a devilish disguise
So I released that snake on the ground and it slithered away
I wished peace upon it and then for my judging I did pray.

This story of the Rainbow Serpent is an Australian aboriginal legend and I have re-told it, with the best of intentions, for an international audience. I may have made some changes to the story  and I hope my re-telling is true to the spirit of the original versions.
the rainbow snake
see it tickles
the frogs
and water fills the rivers and gullies
and waterholes;
and see the rainbow snake
see it brings forth
all life sleeping before
it is the beginning
and the earth is bare and barren
and the Rainbow Serpent
dear Ngalyod, powerful Borlung
the lovely Rainbow Serpent
she moves across the earth
and where she moves
see
how she creates tracks and dry courses
and huge craters;
and see how the Rainbow Serpent
she digs into the earth and emerges crashing into the air
on the other earth side of the world
and see how she throws up mountains and crags
and hills and mounds
and the Uluru and ravines;
and she calls the frogs
who come in heavy and bloated
and she tickles the frogs
and the frogs laugh
and the waters flow and the rains have come
and the dry lands are replete
with billabongs, rivers, creeks and lagoons
and the mighty oceans;
and the Rainbow Serpent is pleased
and she calls forth all
sleeping beings
and they all awake
and the Rainbow Serpent is pleased
and she provides them laws
and she disappears into another waterhole
and you can see her
you can see the Benevolent Rainbow Serpent
as she travels from one waterhole to another
as she emerges from one and she is in the sky
and you can see her
the lovely creative Rainbow Serpent in the sky
and she disappears soon enough
into another huge waterhole
somewhere on our earth
the rainbow snake
see it tickles
the frogs
and water fills the rivers and gullies
and waterholes;
and see the rainbow snake
see it brings forth
all life sleeping before

Leave the self alone
The perfumes of your costumes
That still is in the air
The path we treaded together
In the nights damp darkness
The milky way that be
On earth did it appear
On my hand when you flew
Like a butterfly from that balcony
For gotten I have the world
It only exist in your bosom
My love away from my tavern
You have taken me into garden
For a kiss under the star of morning
For the story of my being
Was but story of my love
In the prologue you announced
But brief how it could be
I shall repeat it again and again
Only for this moment of great ecstasy
For while I leave reason and unreason
For the sage to decipher
My tavern is empty for the master is calling
My goblet is full and in wonders he looks
Saki has removed the veil from her face
Her spell she thinks who has stolen from her
Keep the place in tavern O lovers
He shall come back when he is bitten
A charmer to a snake is he who loves
The poison she carries is deadly indeed
The doors of the tavern my love for you
Are open in the night and the evenings we cherish
Love unto love is like dust unto dust
Of lofty peeks and melting glaciers
My imagery is the lips of my love
Drunk am I from the charm of your love
Wine to me is your kiss divine
Alas Saki keep my place
A charmer to a snake am I indeed

You stole all my smiles away,
There will be no more happiness for me,
Just tears and sadness all day.
You were the snake,
That slithered your way into my world,
Coiled around me,
I felt safe in your hold.
But you tricked and deceived me,
Your plan was to use and to leave me,
But you couldn't just leave it at that,
Before you left,
You were sure to bite poison straight into my back.

Far away in the twilight time
Of every people, in every clime,
Dragons and griffins and monsters dire,
Born of water, and air, and fire,
Or nursed, like the Python, in the mud
And ooze of the old Deucalion flood,
Crawl and wriggle and foam with rage,
Through dusk tradition and ballad age.
So from the childhood of Newbury town
And its time of fable the tale comes down
Of a terror which haunted bush and brake,
The Amphisbaena, the Double Snake!
Thou who makest the tale thy mirth,
Consider that strip of Christian earth
On the desolate shore of a sailless sea,
Full of terror and mystery,
Half redeemed from the evil hold
Of the wood so dreary, and dark, and old,
Which drank with its lips of leaves the dew
When Time was young, and the world was new,
And wove its shadows with sun and moon,
Ere the stones of Cheops were squared and hewn.
Think of the sea's dread monotone,
Of the mournful wail from the pine-wood blown,
Of the strange, vast splendors that lit the North,
Of the troubled throes of the quaking earth,
And the dismal tales the Indian told,
Till the settler's heart at his hearth grew cold,
And he shrank from the tawny wizard boasts,
And the hovering shadows seemed full of ghosts,
And above, below, and on every side,
The fear of his creed seemed verified;-
And think, if his lot were now thine own,
To grope with terrors nor named nor known,
How laxer muscle and weaker nerve
And a feebler faith thy need might serve;
And own to thyself the wonder more
That the snake had two heads, and not a score!
Whether he lurked in the Oldtown fen
Or the gray earth-flax of the Devil's Den,
Or swam in the wooded Artichoke,
Or coiled by the Northman's Written Rock,
Nothing on record is left to show;
Only the fact that be lived, we know,
And left the cast of a double head
In the scaly mask which he yearly shed.
For he carried a head where his tail should be,
And the two, of course, could never agree,
But wriggled about with main and might,
Now to the left and now to the right;
Pulling and twisting this way and that,
Neither knew what the other was at.
A snake with two beads, lurking so near!
Judge of the wonder, guess at the fear!
Think what ancient gossips might say,
Shaking their heads in their dreary way,
Between the meetings on Sabbath-day!
How urchins, searching at day's decline
The Common Pasture for sheep or kine,
The terrible double-ganger heard
In leafy rustle or whir of bird!
Think what a zest it gave to the sport,
In berry-time, of the younger sort,
As over pastures blackberry-twined,
Reuben and Dorothy lagged behind,
And closer and closer, for fear of harm,
The maiden clung to her lover's arm;
And how the spark, who was forced to stay,
By his sweetheart's fears, till the break of day,
Thanked the snake for the fond delay.
Far and wide the tale was told,
Like a snowball growing while it rolled.
The nurse hushed with it the baby's cry;
And it served, in the worthy minister's eye,
To paint the primitive serpent by.
Cotton Mather came galloping down
All the way to Newbury town,
With his eyes agog and his ears set wide,
And his marvellous inkhorn at his side;
Stirring the while in the shallow pool
Of his brains for the lore he learned at school,
To garnish the story, with here a streak
Of Latin, and there another of Greek
And the tales he heard and the notes he took,
Behold! are they not in his Wonder-Book?
Stories, like dragons, are hard to kill.
If the snake does not, the tale runs still
In Byfield Meadows, on Pipestave Hill.
And still, whenever husband and wife
Publish the shame of their daily strife,
And, with mad cross-purpose, tug and strain
At either end of the marriage-chain,
The gossips say, with a knowing shake
Of their gray heads, 'Look at the Double Snake
One in body and two in will,
The Amphisbaena is living still!'

In the name of love, the lord of our hearts,
Let me to say you a story, it never hurts
Of the galaxy and the solar way,
There was a planet that shone in day
Its name was "Mars", great and powerful
It was a little hard, but prideful
There, inside it, with the red stones those just beat
There was a Strange and powerful "Snake" that doesn't hit
They live with each other day and nights,
But they didn't know that they are each other knights
Here the story comes:
A night, when the sky was calm and stars were down,
When the mars was thinking, blinking, at the dawn,
He saw a strange, beauty and unbelievable star,
That was shining like a diamond exactly in the bar,
That star was colorful_ and simple _ though
The mars loved it, liked it although
Mars just looked at that strange nature,
It was strange for him, such a unique creature
Such a UN forgetful vision,
But it was so painful for him, such a scission
Because that star shakes his heart and his lovely feelings,
His soul was thirsty for feeding
Then, a Love contract between them signed,
They will stay with each other to the day of die
They were honest in their love, none of them tinker,
Because they believe who does it is a Stinker,
Of a powerful expression in our life,
They believe and so we do, that love will keep us alive.

The wooden been music
The snake charmer playing
And the melodies breaking,
Haunting
Want I,
Want I to hear
And the snakes dancing,
Swaying to the tune of
The been,
Pumping and puffing
From the mouth
And rotating and rounding
The instrument
And the cobras swaying
Want I,
Want I to hear.
The turbanned and towelled snake charmer
Clad in  dhoti and kurta
playing the music,
The music of the East,
Of Asia
And the dangerous, deadly cobras
Hissing and dancing,
Swaying to the tune of
The wooden been instrument
Dancing joyously
In sheer delight
And the snake charmer
Taking the name of the Snake God
And Ma Manansa,
Playing the been,
Pumping and puffing
To break the tune,
A bag pipe like.

If I should die, think only this of me:
That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,
A body of England's, breathing English air,
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.
And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.

Soldier in your chair of anger
all alone with your deepest pain.
For the way that people now look at you
over and over and over again.
You fought a war that was not your own
on foreign land so far away.
Then came home to loved ones family and friends
in a much, much different way.
Your legs removed your arms now gone
we welcomed you back with flags and patriotic songs.
But now you sit forgotten and alone
while away the bank has taken your home.
So why not sit in the anger you feel?
it is all of what you see to be real.
You fought to protect a world unknown
away from all that you called your home sweet home!

I was a Union soldier.
The battles were long, bloody and tiring.
I often had streaks of blood
All over my uniform.
At times I would feel down.
Really down and depressed,
Full of despair and gloom.
But one time, this family took me in
When I was wounded at Gettysburg.
They pretty much saved my life.
They saved me from dying on the road.
Their little boy would look in
On me with his big bright blue eyes.
He always shared his iced tea with me.
I would watch him rock back and forth
On his wooden horse,
Amazed at how the years had gone by
Since my own childhood.
I went back to visit the family
After the war.
I was saddened to find out
That the little boy had died.
Scarlet fever just up and got him.
A lump formed in my throat,
My heart felt like it had been crushed.
I just cried and cried.
I felt I could almost drown
In all those tears.
Every time I drink some cool iced tea
I remember that little boy.

Back again 'n' nothin' missin' barrin'
arf a hand,
Where an Abdul bit me, chokin' in the Holy
Land.
'Struth, they got some dirty fighters in the
Moslem pack,
Bull-nosed slugs their sneakin' snipers spat
ters in yer back
Blows a gapin' sort iv pit in
What a helephant could sit in.
Bounced their bullets, if yeh please,
Like the 'oppers in a cheese,
Off me rubber pelt in droves,
Moppin' up the other coves.
So here's me once more at large in
Bay-street, Port, a bloomin' Sargin'.
“Cri, it jumbo.” “Have a beer.”
“Wot-o, Anzac; you're a dear.”
Back once more on Moley's corner, loafin' like
a dook;
Back on Bourke, me livin' image, not a
slinkin' spook;
Solid ez the day I started, medals on me
chest,
Switchin' with me pert melacca, swankin'
with the best
Where the little wimmen's flowin',
With their veils 'n' ribbons blowin'-
See their eyes of bloo 'n' brown
Butterflyin' 'bout the town!
Back at 'ome-oh, 'struth, it's good!
Long, cold lagers from the wood,
Ev'ry cobber jumpin' at you,
Strangers duckin' in to bat you-
“Good ole Jumbo, how're you?”
“'Ello, soldier, howja do?”
Back at Grillo's where the nigger googs his
whitey eyes,
Plucks his black ole greasy banjo while the
cod-steak fries;
Fish 'n' chips, a pint iv local, and the tidy
girl
Dancin' glad attendance on yeh 'zif yeh was
an earl;
Trailin' round the blazin' city,
Feelin' all content 'n' pretty,
Where the smart procession goes,
Prinked 'n' polished to the shows,
One among the happy drive-
'Sworth the world to be alive!
Dames ez smilin' ez a mother,
Ev'ry man ver fav'rit brother:
“'Ello, Jumbo, how is it ?”
“Arr there, soldier! Good 'n' fit?”
Takin' hozone at St. Kilder's good enough
for me,
Seein' Summer and the star-blink simmer in
the sea;
Cantin' up me bloomin' cady, toyin' with a
cig.,
Blowin' out me pout a little, chattin' wide 'n'
big
When there's skirt around to skite to.
Say, 'oo has a better right to?
Done me bit 'n' done it well,
Got the tag iv plate to tell;
Square Gallipoli surviver,
With a touch iv Colonel's guyver.
“Sargin' Jumbo, good ole son!”
“Soldier, soldier, you're the one!”
Back again, a wounded hero, moochin' up 'n'
down,
Feelin' 'sthough I'd got a fond arf-Nelson on
the town;
Never was so gay, so 'elp me, never felt so
kind;
Fresh from 'ell a paradise ain't very hard to
find.
After filth, 'n' flies, 'n' slaughter
Fat brown babies in the water,
Singin' people on the sand
Makes a boshter Happy Land!
War what toughened hone 'n' hide
Turned a feller soft inside!
Great it is, the 'earty greetin's,
Friendly digs, 'n' cheerful meetin's
“'Ello, Jumbo, howja do?”
“Soldier, soldier, how're you?”

As I was spittin' into the Ditch aboard o' the ~Crocodile~,
I seed a man on a man-o'-war got up in the Reg'lars' style.
'E was scrapin' the paint from off of 'er plates,
an' I sez to 'im, ''Oo are you?'
Sez 'e, 'I'm a Jolly -- 'Er Majesty's Jolly -- soldier an' sailor too!'
Now 'is work begins by Gawd knows when, and 'is work is never through;
'E isn't one o' the reg'lar Line, nor 'e isn't one of the crew.
'E's a kind of a giddy harumfrodite -- soldier an' sailor too!
An' after I met 'im all over the world, a-doin' all kinds of things,
Like landin' 'isself with a Gatlin' gun to talk to them 'eathen kings;
'E sleeps in an 'ammick instead of a cot,
an' 'e drills with the deck on a slew,
An' 'e sweats like a Jolly -- 'Er Majesty's Jolly -- soldier an' sailor too!
For there isn't a job on the top o' the earth the beggar don't know, nor do --
You can leave 'im at night on a bald man's 'ead, to paddle 'is own canoe --
'E's a sort of a bloomin' cosmopolouse -- soldier an' sailor too.
We've fought 'em in trooper, we've fought 'em in dock,
and drunk with 'em in betweens,
When they called us the seasick scull'ry-maids,
an' we called 'em the Ass Marines;
But, when we was down for a double fatigue, from Woolwich to Bernardmyo,
We sent for the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies -- soldier an' sailor too!
They think for 'emselves, an' they steal for 'emselves,
and they never ask what's to do,
But they're camped an' fed an' they're up an' fed before our bugle's blew.
Ho! they ain't no limpin' procrastitutes -- soldier an' sailor too.
You may say we are fond of an 'arness-cut, or 'ootin' in barrick-yards,
Or startin' a Board School mutiny along o' the Onion Guards;
But once in a while we can finish in style for the ends of the earth to view,
The same as the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies -- soldier an' sailor too!
They come of our lot, they was brothers to us;
they was beggars we'd met an' knew;
Yes, barrin' an inch in the chest an' the arm, they was doubles o' me an' you;
For they weren't no special chrysanthemums -- soldier an' sailor too!
To take your chance in the thick of a rush, with firing all about,
Is nothing so bad when you've cover to 'and, an' leave an' likin' to shout;
But to stand an' be still to the ~Birken'ead~ drill
is a damn tough bullet to chew,
An' they done it, the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies --
soldier an' sailor too!
Their work was done when it 'adn't begun; they was younger nor me an' you;
Their choice it was plain between drownin' in 'eaps
an' bein' mopped by the screw,
So they stood an' was still to the ~Birken'ead~ drill, soldier an' sailor too!
We're most of us liars, we're 'arf of us thieves,
an' the rest are as rank as can be,
But once in a while we can finish in style
(which I 'ope it won't 'appen to me).
But it makes you think better o' you an' your friends,
an' the work you may 'ave to do,
When you think o' the sinkin' ~Victorier~'s Jollies -- soldier an' sailor too!
Now there isn't no room for to say ye don't know --
they 'ave proved it plain and true --
That whether it's Widow, or whether it's ship, Victorier's work is to do,
An' they done it, the Jollies -- 'Er Majesty's Jollies --
soldier an' sailor too!

Soldier, rest! thy warfare o'er,
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking:
Dream of battled fields no more,
Days of danger, nights of waking.
In our isle's enchanted hall,
Hands unseen thy couch are strewing,
Fairy strains of music fall,
Every sense in slumber dewing.
Soldier, rest! thy warfare o'er,
Dream of fighting fields no more:
Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking,
Morn of toil, nor night of waking.
No rude sound shall reach thine ear,
Armour's clang, or war-steed champing,
Trump nor pibroch summon here
Mustering clan, or squadron tramping.
Yet the lark's shrill fife may come
At the day-break from the fallow,
And the bittern sound his drum,
Booming from the sedgy shallow.
Ruder sounds shall none be near,
Guards nor warders challenge here,
Here's no war-steed's neigh and champing,
Shouting clans or squadrons stamping.
Huntsman, rest! thy chase is done,
While our slumbrous spells assail ye,
Dream not, with the rising sun,
Bugles here shall sound reveillé.
Sleep! the deer is in his den;
Sleep! thy hounds are by thee lying;
Sleep! nor dream in yonder glen,
How thy gallant steed lay dying.
Huntsman, rest; thy chase is done,
Think not of the rising sun,
For at dawning to assail ye,
Here no bugles sound reveillé.

Life contracts and death is expected,
As in season of autumn.
The soldier falls.
He does not become a three-days personage.
Imposing his separation,
Calling for pomp.
Death is absolute and without memorial,
As in a season of autumn,
When the wind stops,
When the wind stops and, over the heavens,
The clouds go, nevertheless,
In their direction.

Fighting for freedom,
Fall of a valiant soldier
Resting in the Lord
(Dedicated to my children's grandfather)

There's a graveyard near the White House
Where the Unknown Soldier lies,
And the flowers there are sprinkled
With the tears from mother's eyes.
I stood there not so long ago
With roses for the brave,
And suddenly I heard a voice
Speak from out the grave:
'I am the Unknown Soldier,
The spirit voice began
'And I think I have the right
To ask some questions man to man.
'Are my buddies taken care of?
Was their victory so sweet?
Is that big reward you offered
Selling pencils on the street?
'Did they really win the freedom
They battled to achieve?
Do you still respect that Croix de Guerre
Above that empty sleeve?
'Does a gold star in the window
Now mean anything at all?
I wonder how my old girl feels
When she hears a bugle call.
'And that baby who sang
Hello, Central, give me no man
Can they replace her daddy
With a military band?
'I wonder if the profiteers
Have satisfied their greed?
I wonder if a soldier's mother
Ever is in need?
'I wonder if the kings, who planned it all
Are really satisfied?
They played their game of checkers
And eleven million died.
'I am the Unknown Soldier
And maybe I died in vain,
But if I were alive and my country called,
I'd do it all over again.

Sometimes the skies of tomorrow look bright
crystal blue and full of hope
telling you the best is on its way..
Sometimes the waters of yesterday seem black
showing nothing but the pain you've felt
the tears you've cried; the sorrow you're forced to hide..
Sometimes the world of Today seems revealing
granting you a moment of peace before you take your next step
allowing you for just this one heartbeat to let go.

it’s one of those monumental (nigh impossible)     tasks;
one of Hercules’ labors.
tougher still than those age old questions:
what is love?
or
how much wood could a woodchuck chuck…?
I just cannot put her face into words.
I have tried.
I have a trashcan almost full with
the crumpled thoughts that I deemed unworthy
of her perusal.
'a face so perfect, God dreams
of it in His sleep.
a face that makes me (and her mirror)     the envy of the angels,
the green brush of the Earth.
how she smiles, with the corners
of her mouth spread
like the corners of the sky,
allowing an attentive observer to see
all the majesty and mystery
of
the heavens in her mirth.'
or how I find her eyes so beautiful
and moving that 'they
border on
open heart surgery.'
blah, blah, goddamn blah
I’ve literally tossed away dozens
of verses like these,
I’ve almost given up trying.
it would be so much easier just to tape
a picture of her face to a
piece of paper.
I think that would do so much more justice than anything
I could write.
but, I think she prefers the creativity. oh well,
back to the drawing board...
hey, now there’s an idea!

Take my dreams give them something
I don't know
It's just love inside this
I'll have to show - have to show
Everybody is doing something
And I just know how to sing
Love is sometimes crazy
When it comes to me
And my thoughts get hazy
When they are set to be
Questions asked never are
What they sometimes seem
Everything stays afar
Like a delusional dream
Don't ask me why - I can't tell you
I don't have the answers
There are no certainties to go to
I often have a dream to feel my way
But dreams don't live to become true
I'll make decisions that are up to me
And give the dreams I know
I'll try to be what I can be
In times that come and go
Love is sometimes crazy
When it comes to me
And my thoughts get hazy
When they are set to be
Questions asked never are
What they sometimes seem
Everything stays afar
Like a delusional dream
Don't ask me why -
Love is sometimes crazy
I can't tell you any lie
I can't tell you any lie
Love is sometimes crazy
When it comes to me
And my thoughts get hazy
When they are set to be
Questions asked never are
What they sometimes seem
Everything stays afar
Like a delusional dream
Love is sometimes crazy
But gives so much
We are sometimes crazy
And out of touch
Sometimes crazy
And out of touch
*(I just thought I'd do some differnt 'flicks', now that the Grammy's are coming up in couple of days. This one is written for Seal) .

Sometimes I wished I could fly,
Fly so high up in the sky.
Sometimes I wonder why,
I even eat pie!
But that just isn't it,
We all throw fits.
But none of us resist.
Sometimes girls like us fight over boys,
Just because we want them as toys.
But why? They're just boys
Sometimes I just get so sad,
That all I am is bad.
Does this just mean I have had,
Soemthing very extremely bad,
Sometimes I...

Sometimes when the days and nights that separate us
Stretch out, an endless void
When the distance becomes torturous
The ache, unbearably real
And the embrace of cold air
Cuts deeper than a knife
I begin to wonder how will I get through
This day, this week, this month without you
Why do our souls entwine wondrously,
When we can’t meet
Why do our bodies yearn so longingly,
When the simplest touch is denied
Yes ours is a bonding of souls
In this life, our bodies far removed
But in every life, we will seek each other
Ceaselessly journeying together
On this path, with petals strewn over stones
Finding love, as the light grows.

Sometimes I do not know where I am going.
Sometimes I have no idea where I have been.
Sometimes life is all about the knowing.
And I wonder will I ever win.
Sometimes this road it feels so long.
Sometimes I feel I can see the end.
Sometimes I fall and tumble in my choice of right from wrong.
And I wonder with you will my heart mend.
Sometimes this food does not fill me.
Sometimes this liquor does not numb.
Sometimes I am so lost and lonely.
And I wonder without you will I succumb.
Sometimes I know what I am doing.
Sometimes I barely have a clue.
Sometimes I fall to my knees weeping.
And I wonder will my search ever find you.

Sometimes I’m up,
Sometimes I’m down,
Sometime I even wear a crown.
Of this I know for certain,
I will be there for the final
Curtain.

Across the fields of yesterday
He sometimes comes to me,
A little lad just back from play --
The lad I used to be.
And yet he smiles so wistfully
Once he has crept within,
I wonder if he hopes to see
The man I might have been.

Sometimes
We adapt in tranquility
Yet face the
Insolent society.
Sometimes
We get hurt
In order to grow.
Sometimes
We fail
In order to know.
Sometimes
We feel maturity
Yet unaware off
Our creativity.
Sometimes
We go through
The complexity
To maintain
Our originality.
Sometimes
Our visions broaden
When our eyes
Are washed away
With tears.

I'd known her all my life,
nursed her for seven years
night and day
yet when last night I lay down to sleep
I heard myself say
as if to someone else,
what a splendid lady,
I wish I'd known her better

Flailing nailed to tree of woe
Heartiest deed canst answer lo
Thunder claps atop fated trees
Impending havoc doth not sees
Betwixt ye cut the lancet clean
From the morrow not ye glean
Seeks dismal destiny fairest lock
Rudes loathe that sages mock
Tender feet hath burnt to hock
Crimson beads on braid an frock
Cringe ye that, hell hath send
Shapes the fate an olden bend
Tryst with Eden eagerly fought
Kings which to end hath sought
Wretched fate danced an got
Banshee wails, demons fraught.
Lore stealeth Adam's son.
Simple joys thatch hath done
Truth perishes as ocean raps
Sand grains most doomed to laps
Endless medleys hardly match
Eager that fire an fury snatch
Hear ye Dogs that yell in hell
Twixt, feisty demons fair to dwell
Lap blood off chopping blocks
Claw to bits the ascension rocks
Frenzied death to wistful morns
Contrive flames to fashioned forms.
Consumed reduced in deity's fold.
Vile the smiles that devils behold.

The father conceives his son
the son grows with his father
the spirit allows the heritage
Father, son, spirit. The father says sweet things to his son
the son is a rosebud to his father
the spirit remembers the instant of conception
Spirit, father, son. The father works, gladly
the son at school, learns much
the spirit, lovingly, joins them
Son, father, spirit The son makes his father, a good father
the union of father and son,
is the work of the spirit of love
Spirit, son, father.

Dear Mother
Special wishs from your son
They say a mother's work is never done
and I can vouch for that
You've done a ton
and this day when all the thanks
doesn't seem quite enough
I know you've struggled many times
and had it so rough
an average person would have quit
and said: I've had enough
But you were always watching out for me
protecting me and by my side you'd be
So this day, is special, just for you
For all the little things you've done and do
Today take it easy and let me treat
Sit back and take a rest, put up your feet
and let me cater to you to show I care
To make your life a little more fair
I love you Mom!
Forever in my heart you'll stay!
Enjoy this Happy Mother's Day!

My young son asks me: Must I learn mathematics?
What is the use, I feel like saying. That two pieces
Of bread are more than one's about all you'll end up with.
My young son asks me: Must I learn French?
What is the use, I feel like saying. This State's collapsing.
And if you just rub your belly with your hand and
Groan, you'll be understood with little trouble.
My young son asks me: Must I learn history?
What is the use, I feel like saying. Learn to stick
Your head in the earth, and maybe you'll still survive.
Yes, learn mathematics, I tell him.
Learn your French, learn your history!

Now they have pain in their heart to know

Their worries and pain in their heart you can not see
The tears on their face, you can not wipe
They have loved you and taken care on you.
Why should you take drugs
These are bad for you and kill you slowly
They make you crazy and lazy
Your cough will take your parents breath away
Your ruin health will kill your parents slowly
Not only you ruin your life but also your parents
Say no to drugs and save your life
Say no to drugs and take your parents worries away
Say no to drugs and save your nation's future
You have dream and make it come true

'Twas in the year of 1746, on a fine summer afternoon,
When trees and flowers were in full bloom,
That widow Riddel sat knitting stockings on a little rustic seat,
Which her only son had made for her, which was very neat.
The cottage she lived in was in the wilds of Nithsdale,
Where many a poor soul had cause to bewail
The loss of their shealings, that were burned to the ground,
By a party of fierce British dragoons that chanced to come round.
While widow Riddel sat in her garden she heard an unusual sound,
And near by was her son putting some seeds into the ground,
And as she happened to look down into the little strath below
She espied a party of dragoons coming towards her very slow.
And hearing of the cruelties committed by them, she shook with fear.
And she cried to her son, "Jamie, thae sodgers are coming here!"
While the poor old widow's heart with fear was panting,
And she cried, "Mercy on us, Jamie, what can they be wanting?"
Next minute the dragoons were in front of the cottage door,
When one of them dismounted, and loudly did roar,
"Is there any rebels, old woman, skulking hereabouts?"
"Oh, no, Sir, no! believe my word without any doubts."
"Well, so much the better, my good woman, for you and them;
But, old girl, let's have something to eat, me, and my men":
"Blithely, sir, blithely! ye're welcome to what I hae,"
When she bustled into the cottage without delay.
And she brought out oaten cakes, sweet milk, and cheese,
Which the soldiers devoured greedily at their ease,
And of which they made a hearty meal,
But, for such kind treatment, ungrateful they did feel.
Then one of the soldiers asked her how she got her living:
She replied, "God unto her was always giving;
And wi' the bit garden, alang wi' the bit coo,
And wi' what the laddie can earn we are sincerely thankfu'."
To this pitiful detail of her circumstances the villain made no reply,
But drew a pistol from his holster, and cried, "Your cow must die!"
Then riding up to the poor cow, discharged it through her head,
When the innocent animal instantly fell down dead.
Not satisfied with this the merciless ruffian leaped the little garden wall,
And with his horse trod down everything, the poor widow's all,
Then having finished this barbarous act of direst cruelty,
The monster rejoined his comrades shouting right merrily:
"There, you old devil, that's what you really deserve,
For you and your rascally rebels ought to starve";
Then the party rode off, laughing at the mischief that was done,
Leaving the poor widow to mourn and her only son.
When the widow found herself deprived of her all,
She wrung her hands in despair, and on God did call,
Then rushed into the cottage and flung herself on her bed,
And, with sorrow, in a few days she was dead.
And, during her illness, her poor boy never left her bedside,
There he remained, night and day, his mother's wants to provide,
And make her forget the misfortunes that had befallen them,
All through that villainous and hard-hearted party of men.
On the fourth day her son followed her remains to the grave.
And during the burial service he most manfully did behave,
And when the body was laid in the grave, from tears he could not refrain,
But instantly fled from that desolated place, and never returned again.
Thirteen years after this the famous battle of Minden was fought
By Prince Ferdinand against the French, who brought them to nought;
And there was a large body of British horse, under Lord George Sackville,
And strange! the widow's son was at the battle all the while.
And on the evening after the battle there were assembled in a tavern
A party of British dragoons, loudly boasting and swearing,
When one of them swore he had done more than any of them--
A much more meritorious action-- which he defied them to condemn .
"What was that, Tam, what was that, Tam?" shouted his companions at once.
"Tell us, Tam; tell us, Tam, was that while in France?"
"No!" he cried, "it was starving an old witch, while in Nithsdale,
By shooting her cow and riding down her greens, that is the tale."
"And don't you repent it?" exclaimed a young soldier, present.
"Repent what?" cried the braggart; "No! I feel quite content."
"Then, villain!" cried the youth, unsheathing his sword,
"That woman was my mother, so not another word!
"So draw, and defend yourself, without more delay,
For I swear you shall not live another day!"
Then the villain sprang to his feet, and a combat ensued,
But in three passes he was entirely subdued.
Young Riddell afterwards rose to be a captain
In the British service, and gained a very good name
For being a daring soldier, wherever he went,
And as for killing the ruffian dragoon he never did repent.

He is the Joy a Son brings
sunny eyed;
whip smart
and kind.
A father
and a father alone
can know the pride
of the offspring
who grows
man hood tall
whose steady eye
and large tent heart
which could be fooled
by the devious
but not destroyed.
For  all that words may
not convey
Son let me say
how much you mean to me
and others
you have helped along the way
by being the you
that paused to give mouth to mouth
to an elderly stranger;
adopted sisters and younger brothers;
stayed close to your mother
never forgot your Dad
reached back
even when it hurt
built your life on solid earth
and to this day
celebrates life, undeterred
in your own unique way.
Job well done.

Where the pools are bright and deep,
Where the grey trout lies asleep,
Up the river and over the lea,
That's the way for Billy and me.
Where the blackbird sings the latest,
Where the hawthorn blooms the sweetest,
Where the nestlings chirp and flee,
That's the way for Billy and me.
Where the mowers mow the cleanest,
Where the hay lies thick and greenest,
There to track the homeward bee,
That's the way for Billy and me.
Where the hazel bank is steepest,
Where the shadow falls the deepest,
Where the clustering nuts fall free,
That's the way for Billy and me.
Why the boys should drive away
Little sweet maidens from the play,
Or love to banter and fight so well,
That's the thing I never could tell.
But this I know, I love to play
Through the meadow, among the hay;
Up the water and over the lea,
That's the way for Billy and me.

The hunchèd camels of the night
Trouble the bright
And silver waters of the moon.
The Maiden of the Morn will soon
Through Heaven stray and sing,
Star gathering.
Now while the dark about our loves is strewn,
Light of my dark, blood of my heart, O come!
And night will catch her breath up, and be dumb.
Leave thy father, leave thy mother
And thy brother;
Leave the black tents of thy tribe apart!
Am I not thy father and thy brother,
And thy mother?
And thou--what needest with thy tribe's black tents
Who hast the red pavilion of my heart?

If you wake at midnight, and hear a horse's feet,
Don't go drawing back the blind, or looking in the street.
Them that ask no questions isn't told a lie.
Watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!
Five and twenty ponies,
Trotting through the dark --
Brandy for the Parson,
'Baccy for the Clerk;
Laces for a lady, letters for a spy,
And watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!
Running round the woodlump if you chance to find
Little barrels, roped and tarred, all full of brandy-wine,
Don't you shout to come and look, nor use 'em for your play.
Put the brishwood back again -- and they'll be gone next day!
If you see the stable-door setting open wide;
If you see a tired horse lying down inside;
If your mother mends a coat cut about and tore;
If the lining's wet and warm -- don't you ask no more!
If you meet King George's men, dressed in blue and red,
You be carefull what you say, and mindful what is said.
If they call you "pretty maid," and chuck you 'neath the chin,
Don't you tell where no one is, nor yet where no one's been!
Knocks and footsteps round the house -- whistles after dark --
You've no call for running out till the house-dogs bark.
Trusty's here, and Pincher's here, and see how dumb they lie --
They don't fret to follow when the Gentlemen go by!
If you do as you've been told, 'likely there's a chance,
You'll be given a dainty doll, all the way from France,
With a cap of Valenciennes, and a velvet hood --
A present from the Gentlemen, along o' being good!
Five and twenty ponies,
Trotting through the dark --
Brandy for the Parson,
'Baccy for the Clerk;
Them that asks no questions isn't told a lie --
Watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!

I THOUGHT no more was needed
Youth to polong
Than dumb-bell and foil
To keep the body young.
O who could have foretold
That thc heart grows old?
Though I have many words,
What woman's satisfied,
I am no longer faint
Because at her side?
O who could have foretold
That the heart grows old?
I have not lost desire
But the heart that I had;
I thOught 'twould burn my body
Laid on the death-bed,
For who could have foretold
That the heart grows old?

Your house is
Falling down
Around
Your
Feet,
And you got
Nought
To eat,
Don't worry
Be happy.
Your fish
Have drowned
You wear
A frown,
You search
But you don't
Own a pound,
Don't worry
Be happy.
You ain't got
Nowhere to
Play,
Just balconies
And
Motorways,
Don't worry
Be happy.
You meet
Someone
You really like,
They tell you to
Get on your bike,
Don't worry
Be happy.
You're on your bike
And all is fine,
You get caught
In a washing line,
Don't worry
Be happy.
You go to school
The school is
Gone,
The Government
Put pressure on,
Don't worry
Be happy.
Your tea is
Dry
Your ice is
Hot,
Your head is
Tied up in a
Not,
Don't worry
Be happy.
You worry
Because
You're hurrying,
And hurry
Because
You're worrying,
Don't happy
Be worried.

My own dear love, he is strong and bold
And he cares not what comes after.
His words ring sweet as a chime of gold,
And his eyes are lit with laughter.
He is jubilant as a flag unfurled --
Oh, a girl, she'd not forget him.
My own dear love, he is all my world, --
And I wish I'd never met him.
My love, he's mad, and my love, he's fleet,
And a wild young wood-thing bore him!
The ways are fair to his roaming feet,
And the skies are sunlit for him.
As sharply sweet to my heart he seems
As the fragrance of acacia.
My own dear love, he is all my dreams, --
And I wish he were in Asia.
My love runs by like a day in June,
And he makes no friends of sorrows.
He'll tread his galloping rigadoon
In the pathway of the morrows.
He'll live his days where the sunbeams start,
Nor could storm or wind uproot him.
My own dear love, he is all my heart, --
And I wish somebody'd shoot him.

Again rejoicing nature sees
Her robe assume its vernal hues,
Her leafy looks wave in the breeze,
All freshly steep'd in morning dews.
And maun I still on Menie doat,
And bear the scorn that's in her ee?
For it's jet, jet black, an' it's like a hawk,
An' it winna let a body be!
In vain to me the cowslips blaw,
In vain to me the vi'lets spring;
In vain to me, in glen or shaw,
The mavis and the lintwhite sing.
And maun I still...
The merry ploughboy cheers his team,
Wi' joy the tentie seedsman stalks,
But life to me 's a weary dream,
A dream of ane that never wauks.
And maun I still...
The wanton coot the water skims,
Among the reeds the ducklings cry,
The stately swan majestic swims,
And every thing is blest but I.
And maun I still...
The shepherd steeks his faulding slap,
And owre the moorlands whistles shill,
Wi' wild, unequal, wand'ring step,
I meet him on the dewy hill.
And maun I still...
And when the lark, 'tween light and dark,
Blythe waukens by the daisy's side,
And mounts and sings on fluttering wings,
A woe-worn ghaist I hameward glide.
And maun I still...
Come, Winter, with thine angry howl,
And raging bend the naked tree;
Thy gloom will soothe my cheerless soul,
When Nature all is sad like me!
And maun I still...

When I am dead, my dearest,
Sing no sad songs for me;
Plant thou no roses at my head,
Nor shady cypress tree:
Be the green grass above me
With showers and dewdrops wet;
And if thou wilt, remember,
And if thou wilt, forget.
I shall not see the shadows,
I shall not feel the rain;
I shall not hear the nightingale
Sing on, as if in pain:
And dreaming through the twilight
That doth not rise nor set,
Haply I may remember,
And haply may forget.

I.
If souls could sing to heaven's high King
As blackbirds pipe on earth,
How those delicious courts would ring
With gusts of lovely mirth!
What white-robed throng could lift a song
So mellow with righteous glee
As this brown bird that all day long
Delights my hawthorn tree.
Hark! That's the thrush
With speckled breast
From yon white bush
Chaunting his best,
Te Deum! Te Deum laudamus!
II.
If earthly dreams be touched with gleams
Of Paradisal air,
Some wings, perchance, of earth may glance
Around our slumbers there;
Some breaths of may might drift our way
With scents of leaf and loam,
Some whistling bird at dawn be heard
From those old woods of home.
Hark! That's the thrush
With speckled breast
From yon white bush
Chaunting his best,
Te Deum! Te Deum laudamus!
III.
No King or priest shall mar my feast
Where'er my soul may range.
I have no fear of heaven's good cheer
Unless our Master change.
But when death's night is dying away,
If I might choose my bliss,
My love should say, at break of day,
With her first waking kiss:--
Hark! That's the thrush
With speckled breast,
From yon white bush
Chaunting his best,
Te Deum! Te Deum laudamus!

If you look
upon Afghani's sorrow
Will you tell...
Does your heart
feel empathy...
Do tears  well
in your eyes...
The life of the Afghan
like open wounds
seeks healing
will kindness you extend
Oh Big Boss!
You the teacher
of brutal behavior
please step aside
for peace and prosperity.

Today i celebrate my sorrow
Though its  heck of a pain in my heart
But in the land of the dead
With heartless torso and fake souls
I celebrate my pain......
cuz lucky i am
To still feel........

In the moon-fade and the sun’s puppy breath,
in the crow’s plummeting cry,
in my broken foot and arthritic joints,
memory calls me
to the earth’s opening, the graves dug, again, and again
I, always I am left
to turn away
into a bat’s wing-brush of air.
That never changes . . .
not this morning, not here
where I’ve just found
in the back of my truck, under the rubber mat,
in a teacup’s worth of dirt,
where it seems no seed could possibly be
a corn kernel split to pale leaves and string-roots.
It’s a strange leap but I make it
and bend to these small harvests
because somewhere in North Carolina there was a house
and in it, my room and my bed,
bare boards and the blood stains of a man
that in each slant rain’s worried whispers puddles to the cries of a slave,
murdered in 1863 trying to escape.
Somewhere there was a child who slept
on the living room’s red-vinyl couch
who still matters
especially now that I can’t remember when the creek
that bounded our family farm led to an ocean
or when a boxcar’s weather-wasted letters spelling Illinois
meant somewhere there was an Illinois.
It’s still 1976--
the day after I’ve been seen playing tennis
with a black boy, and it seems I will always
be held at gunpoint and beaten
as if the right punch would chunk out his name.
--------
No, it’s 1969--
The year my mother becomes a wax paste,
or so she looks to the child I was,
and she drips into the pink satin
and I learned the funereal smell of carnations.
That year the moon was still made of green cheese.
That year men first bagged and labeled that moon.
There are no years, only the past
and I still don’t know why Odell Horne
pulled a shotgun on my brother
or how the body contains so much blood.
I still don’t know why Donna Hill went to Myrtle Beach
and three days later came back dead.
For ten years I lived with Louise Stegall,
the lover of my father, one of her four men, all buried--
suicide, murder, drink, again murder.
It was after the second one that she sat stock still
and silent, four years in the asylum.
Now she walks the road all day,
picking up Cracker Jack trinkets
to give to children
brave enough to approach her.
When I was nine, the starling pecked outside her windowa whole week.
Somebody’s gonna die, she said
and made me hug Uncle Robert’s neck
as if I couldn’t know he’d be gone in two hours,
as if I hadn’t learned anything about people
and their vanishing.
The last time I saw her she wouldn’t look at me,
jerked her sweatshirt’s hood across
her face and stepped into the ditch,
as though there are some things even she won’t tell,
as though I’ve never known it’s dirt and dust after all--
the earth’s sink and the worms’ castings.
--------
With the wet leaves thick on my steps,
the evening sky bruised dull gray to black,
when I’ve spilt salt and as the saying goes the sorrow and tears,
and the stove is cold so salt won’t burn,
tell me my pocket of charms can counter any spell.
Tell me again the reason for my grandfather’s fingers
afloat in the Mason jar on the fireplace mantel
between the snuff tin and the bowl of circus peanuts.
What about the teeth in the dresser bureau,
the sliver of back bone I wear around my neck?
Again the washed-out photo in the family album,
Pacific wind lifting the small waves onto Coral Beach,
clicking the palm trees’ fronds.
Again my father’s rakish grin,
his bayonet catching a scratch of sun,
his left foot propped on the stripped and bloodied body.
Behind him, a stack of Japanese.
--------
Let me believe in anything.
Doesn’t the grizzled chicken dig up hoodoo hands?
Won’t the blue door frame, the basket of acorns protect me;
what about the knife in a pail of water?
When giving me the dead’s slippered feet
room to room,
why not also synchronicity’s proof,
a wish and the tilted ears of angels?
I want to believe in the power of rosemary
knuckled along the fence
even as the stars order themselves
to an unalterable and essential law.
I want the wind-whipped leaves to settle
and the flattened scrub to right itself,
want the loose tin in the neighbor’s shed
to finish its message.
When this season in its scoured exactitude shifts closer,
give me Devil’s Blue Boletus through the piled leaves,
the slender green of Earth Tongue,
phosphorescent Honey Tuft dispatched by the dead.
Their voices coming nearer, almost deciphered.
Whatever lies you have
there in that nail-clipping of time,
give them to me.

Then a woman said, "Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow."
And he answered:
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.
Is not the cup that hold your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
Some of you say, "Joy is greater than sorrow," and others say, "Nay, sorrow is the greater."
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.

When i dream i dream of sorrow,
My dreams are long and dark,
I can hear the sond but never see the color,
My dreams leave me awake some nights thinking,
Some dreams are more of a story,
But all have sarrow and pure sadness,
The trees are dead im the last alive,
All my dreams end the same,
A rock and a bang,
The rock is the earth,
More sorrow then the night before,
My dreams are deep and make me wright things like this,
The more i dream the more i cry,
The more i cry the more i think about my own death,
Will a die at 90 of age or 15 from a gun,
Will the killing ever stop,
Will we ever know how the world ends,
My dreams paint a dark and stormy picture,
My poems paint a clear,
My mind crys of dark things like this,
My hart crys harder and harder,
Between sweet and sour,
I think the end will end sour,
Are we to end in fire or ice,
You chose i would rather end in ice,

I still remember the soft touch of your hand,
As I stand here lonely in this foreign land.
And can you remember how I loved you?
Does love still glow in those eyes of blue?
Sing me that song those birds sang long ago.
Hold me close in those arms and never let me go.
Don't say you are leaving as you have done before.
Say we will be together today and forevermore....
Let's walk together and talk of what has been done,
And then go for a swim in the bright sun.
As I get the feeling the time is drawing near,
I will hug you to me and cry a sorrowed tear.
The memories were special, for now they are gone,
But I still recall each one with every rising dawn.
One last goodbye, parting forevermore.
One last kiss, more feverish than before.
I cherish our  love,
It's tender, sweet song.
And hope in my heart,
This parting won't be long.

the tear of sorrow runs down my cheek
friendship is what I seek
I used to think I had it all
but now my backs against the wall
and my heart has been broken
and these words are unspoken
I look back at my past
and wish the sorrow would end my life at last...

My soul is cold as ice.
My heart is darker then the void.
Nothing seems nice.
All happiness devoid.
I feel nothing.
Except that of pain.
I've looked for that one something.
But I just ended up crying in the rain.
My tears are dry.
They could fill the deepest oceans.
The end seems nigh.
There is only pain, no other emotions.
My hope, my life...shattered.
I cannot pick up the pieces.
It's not like I mattered.
But my sorrow increases.
I have been mocked, betrayed, and destroyed.
No medication can numb my hurt.
All those around me seem overjoyed.
When my face is shoved into the dirt.
My God has left me.
Sitting up in his throne.
I did not want to be his enemy.
I'll just sit here and moan.
My love has thrown me aside.
Like damaged goods.
I wish I just would have died.
In a grave unmarked in the deepest of woods.
And so here I am.
I am not sure if I will be alive tomorrow.
I just don't give a damn.
I am going to drown in my sorrow.

THE brawling of a sparrow in the eaves,
The brilliant moon and all the milky sky,
And all that famous harmony of leaves,
Had blotted out man's image and his cry.
A girl arose that had red mournful lips
And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;
Arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,
A climbing moon upon an empty sky,
And all that lamentation of the leaves,
Could but compose man's image and his cry.

your sorrow and my sorrow
are not really ours to keep.
They belong to the earth,
to the heart of the earth
inside its beautiful bosom.
let us leave them just right
there, secure and honed.
we are leaving now to
another sphere, the one
that we see in our dreams
the more colored ones
feel the excitement, keep
yourself poised to something
more lasting more divine.

At last the air fragrant, the bird's bubbling whistle
Succinct in the unknown unsettled trees:
O little Charles, beside the Georgian colleges
And milltown New England; at last the wind soft,
The sky unmoving, and the dead look
Of factory windows separate, at last,
From windows gray and wet:
for now the sunlight
Thrashes its wet shellac on brickwalk and gutter,
White splinters streak midmorning and doorstep,
Winter passes as the lighted streetcar
Moves at midnight, one scene of the past,
Droll and unreal, stiff, stilted and hooded.

Here the white-ray'd anemone is born,
Wood-sorrel, and the varnish'd buttercup;
And primrose in its purfled green swathed up,
Pallid and sweet round every budding thorn,
Gray ash, and beech with rusty leaves outworn.
Here, too the darting linnet hath her nest
In the blue-lustred holly, never shorn,
Whose partner cheers her little brooding breast,
Piping from some near bough. O simple song!
O cistern deep of that harmonious rillet,
And these fair juicy stems that climb and throng
The vernal world, and unexhausted seas
Of flowing life, and soul that asks to fill it,
Each and all of these,--and more, and more than these!

Cloud-topped and splendid, dominating all
The little lesser hills which compass thee,
Thou standest, bright with April's buoyancy,
Yet holding Winter in some shaded wall
Of stern, steep rock; and startled by the call
Of Spring, thy trees flush with expectancy
And cast a cloud of crimson, silently,
Above thy snowy crevices where fall
Pale shrivelled oak leaves, while the snow beneath
Melts at their phantom touch. Another year
Is quick with import. Such each year has been.
Unmoved thou watchest all, and all bequeath
Some jewel to thy diadem of power,
Thou pledge of greater majesty unseen.

A spring morning – well,
I only need to say the words?
I’ll picture mine, you picture yours –
champagne bubbling in the blood and in the mind,
hopes and possibilities flooding freshly in..
but a spring mid-afternoon… like today, like now:
a subtle balance of the elements;
the sunlight bathes the room, but  gently,
with its promise; yet,
there’s a timeless peace with it
that’s like a life surveyed; yet
free of thought, of comparison, or of regret:
the six loved paintings that adorn the walls
bought for a song, when art was like a song –
they love the gentle sunlight, and it in turn loves them;
five artists painting their sunlit peace, their happiness;
(two very different ones from the man
who lives so humbly halfway up
the mountain hills he rambles every day):
three oils; one gouache; one watercolour; and one pastel;
they all but two have clouds in them
as they’re all landscapes;
one that hasn’t, has a haze as if
the painter’s painting the summer wind, in those high hills..
the other is a cloudless morning’s peace,
the bend of a river in mid-France;
the river…it  cannot be, just painted oil?
it’s water seen as by a pure clear soul…
and the clouds – caught in an impossibility of time,
play out an endless drama of the elements;
timeless in the peace of, now, a slightly later
springtime afternoon; almost with a touch...
but how could  perfection ever regret
its own departure?

I feel the Spring far off, far off,
The faint far scent of bud and leaf--
Oh how can Spring take heart to come
To a world in grief,
Deep grief?
The sun turns north, the days grow long,
Later the evening star grows bright--
How can the daylight linger on
For men to fight,
Still fight?
The grass is waking in the ground,
Soon it will rise and blow in waves--
How can it have the heart to sway
Over the graves,
New graves?
Under the boughs where lovers walked
The apple-blooms will shed their breath--
But what of all the lovers now
Parted by death,
Gray Death?

To what purpose, April, do you return again?
Beauty is not enough.
You can no longer quiet me with the redness
Of little leaves opening stickily.
I know what I know.
The sun is hot on my neck as I observe
The spikes of the crocus.
The smell of the earth is good.
It is apparent that there is no death.
But what does that signify?
Not only under ground are the brains of men
Eaten by maggots.
Life in itself
Is nothing,
An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.
It is not enough that yearly, down this hill,
April
Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.

I thought I had forgotten,
But it all came back again
To-night with the first spring thunder
In a rush of rain.
I remembered a darkened doorway
Where we stood while the storm swept by,
Thunder gripping the earth
And lightning scrawled on the sky.
The passing motor busses swayed,
For the street was a river of rain,
Lashed into little golden waves
In the lamp light's stain.
With the wild spring rain and thunder
My heart was wild and gay;
Your eyes said more to me that night
Than your lips would ever say. . . .
I thought I had forgotten,
But it all came back again
To-night with the first spring thunder
In a rush of rain.

Man goes to Man! Cry the challenge through the Jungle!
He that was our Brother goes away.
Hear, now, and judge, O ye People of the Jungle--
Answer, who can turn him--who shall stay?
Man goes to Man! He is weeping in the Jungle:
He that was our Brother sorrows sore!
Man goes to Man! (Oh, we loved him in the Jungle!)
To the Man-Trail where we may not follow more.

I heard a thousand blended notes
While in a grove I sat reclined,
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.
To her fair works did Nature link
The human soul that through me ran;
And much it grieved my heart to think
What Man has made of Man.
Through primrose tufts, in that sweet bower,
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
And 'tis my faith that every flower
Enjoys the air it breathes.
The birds around me hopped and played,
Their thoughts I cannot measure -
But the least motion which they made
It seemed a thrill of pleasure.
The budding twigs spread out their fan
To catch the breezy air;
And I must think, do all I can,
That there was pleasure there.
If this belief from heaven be sent,
If such be Nature's holy plan,
Have I not reason to lament
What Man has made of Man?

Your a thousand stars away.
The brightest shining star in the sky.
You are the glisten of the rain.
And the glistening of the stars.
Your a thousand starlights away.
But still you live in my heart.
I love you still the same.
If love could of saved you.
You would still be here today.
Love lives forever
So reall you did not die
So I never will forget you.
Well untill my time.
I will keep you in my heart.
When my time comes.
I will see you again

Star, star, you shine so bright
Lighting even my darkest night…
You make me smile
If only for a little while…
You remind me of the presence
Of my Lord most high,
As you shine so proudly in the sky…
I love a star lit night so true
It causes my emotions
To drift away
It makes me feel less blue…
When I am down and feel so out of place
Gazing upon your beauty causes a smile
To return to my face…
May I make a make believe wish upon you tonight
And can you tell me if my future will be bright
Stars, stars forever shine
For you are all favorites of mine

Will you dance with me?
Will you set me free?
Will you love me true?
and I'll be there for you.
Will you care for us?
Without any fuss
coz Im in love with you
and you love me too
Will you stand by me?
Will you stay not flee
Will you pray at night
That I'll see the light
Will we be forever?
Now we are together
Your my guiding star
You know who you are

If winter, you wake up at four
From behind the closed window-door,
Whilst struggling to fight wintry chill,
I'm tucked in my cosy bed still.
At six no sun still, nor dawn's clout
But day's diurnal reign's not in doubt,
Dawn slowly shows up crimson red,
Reluctant I stir in my bed.
But you still rule early dawn's sky
Heedless of that cockerel cry
Announcing the reign of the sun,
And at that rooster's rant you yawn.
Seven, you nearly kiss zenith,
Whilst sun shows its bright tip beneath,
And prepares to rule all the day,
You curtail your magical sway.
And when at tall zenith you set—
Not that life's horizon you met,
We of East whilst give you a pat,
In West perhaps they doff their hat.
O brightest morning star, Venus,
As twilight star you're loved no less.

Sky Star…., so far….., on a peaceful night….,
Blinking…, twinkling…, with a wondrous light…,
Sky Star…., so far…., sparkling so bright….,
Shimmering…, quivering…, on a peaceful night.
Celestial flame…. Glowing with delight….,
Gleaming, flashing, glimmering white….,
Radiant spirit…., such a beautiful sight…,
Sky Star…., so far….., on a peaceful night.

Star, that gives a gracious dole,
What am I to choose?
Oh, will it be a shriven soul,
Or little buckled shoes?
Shall I wish a wedding-ring,
Bright and thin and round,
Or plead you send me covering-
A newly spaded mound?
Gentle beam, shall I implore
Gold, or sailing-ships,
Or beg I hate forevermore
A pair of lying lips?
Swing you low or high away,
Burn you hot or dim;
My only wish I dare not say-
Lest you should grant me him.

Lo! in the paintedoriel of the West,
Whose panes the sunken sun incarnadines,
Like a fair lady at her casement, shines
The evening star, the star of love and rest!
And then anon she doth herself divest
Of all her radiant garments, and reclines
Behind the sombre screen of yonder pines,
With slumber and soft dreams of love oppressed.
O my beloved, my sweet Hesperus!
My morning and my evening star of love!
My best and gentlest lady! even thus,
As that fair planet in the sky above,
Dost thou retire unto thy rest at night,
And from thy darkened window fades the light.

Every whisper that one hear is the name that has respect and yet just to look in the eyes of the stars of Star bucks is the star of respect that will fill once heart with the respect of Star bucks when one smile thus one smile with respect.
When the birds sing for they sing with happiness just to see the blue sky is like seeing the moon light of a angel of Star bucks yet when there is happiness thus one feel the touch of respect in once heart for the stars of Star bucks.
For every min that one see the family of Star bucks for one feel the touch of respect from the family of Star bucks star after star shall whisper the name of Star bucks in once dreams just to taste a good cup of coffee thus the star that whisper the name of Star bucks.

Morning star from where you are
Can you see my tiny heart
From so many
Can you see the only me
Can you see me way down here
Making a wish, oh can you hear
Oh morning star
I am wishing with all my heart
All I want in all my life
Is someone to walk beside in life
So lonely, I’m so lonely
Can you make it right
Grandpa had always told me
The first star that I see
Make a wish upon the morning star
The morning star will answer me
Morning star, morning star
Can me down here you find
Would you take away the loneliness
Could you ever be so kind.

Confidence is Beauty
Beauty is Art
Art is Performance
Performance is Excellence
Excellence is Responsibility
Responsibility is Collectivism
Collectivism is Accountability
Accountability is State of Art
In turn
State of Art is Beauty
Beauty is Confidence
Confidence is Success
Success is
“ Let not loose any one
In the game of life”
'Wish you all happy new year-2010'

In the hearts of men
The key to success...
You have it in you

Mother's fine china -
a stack of dishes
I couldn't eat with the adults
'twas against her wishes
So I stand at the sink
I will wash her grime
but first, I think
that it's 'break time'

Fish would think those are winners who swim fast.
Lions may insist those are losers who run last.
It's ridiculous to mold yourself into their value cast
If you are a bird who can only fly to get your lifetime pleasantly passed.

Failures infinite in life
Despair-- Demoralisation--- Depression-
Hence success by mere thoughts
At least momentary happiness-- bliss--- ecstasy--
To reap the joy of the implausible
The unattained fulfilment of the feat
Which proved to be defeat
Thus success in failure.
Note: With umpteen failures in life where there's no success at all a bit of momentary happiness can be gained by thinking of it.

success is what i feel when i achieve something
success is what i feel when i believe in god
success is what i feel when i have a good relationship
success is what i feel when i have a good job
success is what i feel when my life is complete

Success means being successful.

Success is a journey not a destination a year from
now you may wish you had started today.
Every beginner is a winner.  Success is not escaping problems but facing them creatively.
There is no success without sacrifice.
Great success always calls for great sacrifice.
Even failure can become an important ingredient to success.
Failure just means that you have not yet succeeded.
I’d rather change my mind and succeed than have my own way and fail.  Success without conflict is unrealistic.
Any person can be successful on smooth seas,
but it is the victory over the storm that gains true honor.
Success doesn’t come through the way you think it comes;
it comes through the way you think.
Never settle for less than success.
Success is doing something good.
When you can, where you can, while you can.
It’s better to attempt to do something great and fail,
than attempt to do nothing and succeed.
Success is not necessarily reaching your goal- but reaching the maximum possibilities in light of the opportunities that come your way.
To keep your values on target remember to live so that when you “arrive”, you’ll have pride behind you and hope ahead of you.
The success is truly the path to heaven.
Success is never ending, because success is like the process of seed planting.  Every creative contribution like a seed planted may bear fruit.
Success finally is not what you have it is not what you do;
it is who you are, and what
you want to become of yourself.

What is success it has never been mine
In their different ways people it do define
Some see success as money to your name
As a lack of such a barrier to fame
Though others with such thinking do not agree
Success in quite a different way they do see
They will tell you that you cannot know of success
If in your mind no room for happiness
And some do say for a successful life
You do not need what's known as inner strife
The successful person does seem quite carefree
On what success is so few do agree
We all do look at things quite differently
That's how it is and that's how 'twill always be.

Welcome, rain or tempest
From yon airy powers,
We have languished for them
Many sultry hours,
And earth is sick and wan, and pines with all her flowers.
What have they been doing
In the burning June?
Riding with the genii?
Visiting the moon?
Or sleeping on the ice amid an arctic noon?
Bring they with them jewels
From the sunset lands?
What are these they scatter
With such lavish hands?
There are no brighter gems in Raolconda's sands.
Pattering on the gravel,
Dropping from the eaves,
Glancing in the grass, and
Tinkling on the leaves,
They flash the liquid pearls as flung from fairy sieves.
Meanwhile, unreluctant,
Earth like Danae lies;
Listen! is it fancy,
That beneath us sighs,
As that warm lap receives the largesse of the skies?
Jove, it is, descendeth
In those crystal rills;
And this world-wide tremor
Is a pulse that thrills
To a god's life infused through veins of velvet hills.
Wait, thou jealous sunshine,
Break not on their bliss;
Earth will blush in roses
Many a day for this,
And bend a brighter brow beneath thy burning kiss.

No matter how hard I listen, the wind speaks
One syllable, which has no comfort in it--
Only a rasping of air through the dead elm.

Once a poet told me of his friend who was torn apart
By two pigs in a field in Poland. The man
Was a prisoner of the Nazis, and they watched,
He said, with interest and a drunken approval . . .
If terror is a state of complete understanding,
Then there was probably a point at which the man
Went mad, and felt nothing, though certainly
He understood everything that was there: after all,
He could see blood splash beneath him on the stubble,
He could hear singing float toward him from the barracks.
*
And though I don't know much about madness,
I know it lives in the thin body like a harp
Behind the rib cage. It makes it painful to move.
And when you kneel in madness your knees are glass,
And so you must stand up again with great care.
*
Maybe this wind was what he heard in 1941.
Maybe I have raised a dead man into this air,
And now I will have to bury him inside my body,
And breathe him in, and do nothing but listen--
Until I hear the black blood rushing over
The stone of my skull, and believe it is music.
But some things are not possible on the earth.
And that is why people make poems about the dead.
And the dead watch over then, until they are finished:
Until their hands feel like glass on the page,
And snow collects in the blind eyes of statues.

In that summer of loving you
I was free
All things were possible
And I believed them all
In that summer of loving you
I was beautiful
I saw myself in your eyes
And I was wonderful
In that summer of loving you
I danced with passion
In and out of arms of love
And you held me
In that summer of loving you
I was laughter
You laughed with me
But never at me
In that summer of loving you
I lost you
And my heart was breaking...   As you left me

I'd walk her home after work
buying roses and talking of Bechsteins.
She was full of soul.
Her small room was gorged with heat
and there were no windows.
She'd take off everything
but her pants
and take the pins from her hair
throwing them on the floor
with a great noise.
Like Crete.
We wouldn't make love.
She'd get on the bed
with those nipples
and we'd lie
sweating
and talking of my best friend.
They were in love.
When I got quiet
she'd put on usually Debussy
and
leaning down to the small ribs
bite me.
Hard.

When the sun shouts and people abound
One thinks there were the ages of stone and the age of
bronze
And the iron age; iron the unstable metal;
Steel made of iron, unstable as his mother; the tow-
ered-up cities
Will be stains of rust on mounds of plaster.
Roots will not pierce the heaps for a time, kind rains
will cure them,
Then nothing will remain of the iron age
And all these people but a thigh-bone or so, a poem
Stuck in the world's thought, splinters of glass
In the rubbish dumps, a concrete dam far off in the
mountain...

They come back in their white
shifts, their ruffled shawls of salt
white, the way the dead always return
when you need them the most—
when it's too hot to do anything
but picture the worst—the Bomb
finally fallen, the world burned-up,
the entire planet radioactive—
when you are too weak to do anything
but lie in a stupor and call them back
to drift at your side, in eyelet dresses
of old starlight, fresh-faced and cold.
Anonymous submission.

Bend low again, night of summer stars.
So near you are, sky of summer stars,
So near, a long-arm man can pick off stars,
Pick off what he wants in the sky bowl,
So near you are, summer stars,
So near, strumming, strumming,
So lazy and hum-strumming.

My books I'd fain cast off, I cannot read,
'Twixt every page my thoughts go stray at large
Down in the meadow, where is richer feed,
And will not mind to hit their proper targe.
Plutarch was good, and so was Homer too,
Our Shakespeare's life were rich to live again,
What Plutarch read, that was not good nor true,
Nor Shakespeare's books, unless his books were men.
Here while I lie beneath this walnut bough,
What care I for the Greeks or for Troy town,
If juster battles are enacted now
Between the ants upon this hummock's crown?
Bid Homer wait till I the issue learn,
If red or black the gods will favor most,
Or yonder Ajax will the phalanx turn,
Struggling to heave some rock against the host.
Tell Shakespeare to attend some leisure hour,
For now I've business with this drop of dew,
And see you not, the clouds prepare a shower--
I'll meet him shortly when the sky is blue.
This bed of herd's grass and wild oats was spread
Last year with nicer skill than monarchs use.
A clover tuft is pillow for my head,
And violets quite overtop my shoes.
And now the cordial clouds have shut all in,
And gently swells the wind to say all's well;
The scattered drops are falling fast and thin,
Some in the pool, some in the flower-bell.
I am well drenched upon my bed of oats;
But see that globe come rolling down its stem,
Now like a lonely planet there it floats,
And now it sinks into my garment's hem.
Drip drip the trees for all the country round,
And richness rare distills from every bough;
The wind alone it is makes every sound,
Shaking down crystals on the leaves below.
For shame the sun will never show himself,
Who could not with his beams e'er melt me so;
My dripping locks--they would become an elf,
Who in a beaded coat does gayly go.

The church bells toll a melancholy round,
Calling the people to some other prayers,
Some other gloominess, more dreadful cares,
More harkening to the sermon's horrid sound.
Surely the mind of man is closely bound
In some blind spell: seeing that each one tears
Himself from fireside joys and Lydian airs,
And converse high of those with glory crowned.
Still, still they toll, and I should feel a damp,
A chill as from a tomb, did I not know
That they are dying like an outburnt lamp, -
That 'tis their sighing, wailing, ere they go
Into oblivion -that fresh flowers will grow,
And many glories of immortal stamp.

the sun
is generous
as dad
in his love
we bask
so bright
and true
the moon
is selfless
as mom
pinning
day and night
to make sure
we shine
crowding
round her
like little stars

Light breaks where no sun shines;
Where no sea runs, the waters of the heart
Push in their tides;
And, broken ghosts with glowworms in their heads,
The things of light
File through the flesh where no flesh decks the bones.
A candle in the thighs
Warms youth and seed and burns the seeds of age;
Where no seed stirs,
The fruit of man unwrinkles in the stars,
Bright as a fig;
Where no wax is, the candle shows its hairs.
Dawn breaks behind the eyes;
From poles of skull and toe the windy blood
Slides like a sea;
Nor fenced, nor staked, the gushers of the sky
Spout to the rod
Divining in a smile the oil of tears.
Night in the sockets rounds,
Like some pitch moon, the limit of the globes;
Day lights the bone;
Where no cold is, the skinning gales unpin
The winter's robes;
The film of spring is hanging from the lids.
Light breaks on secret lots,
On tips of thought where thoughts smell in the rain;
When logics die,
The secret of the soil grows through the eye,
And blood jumps in the sun;
Above the waste allotments the dawn halts.

Oh day of fire and sun,
Pure as a naked flame,
Blue sea, blue sky and dun
Sands where he spoke my name;
Laughter and hearts so high
That the spirit flew off free,
Lifting into the sky
Diving into the sea;
Oh day of fire and sun
Like a crystal burning,
Slow days go one by one,
But you have no returning.

My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks,
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,
That music hath a far more pleasing sound.
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare.

It is mid-afternoon now,
the sun streaks slant wards
through the attic's double-glazing
melting the scorched ink
in my crowded note-book
that lies blanched
on the sparse weathered table.
Hardened sepia-stained lines
that once approximated to
a flock of metaphors,
now rearrange themselves
into a congregation of phrases,
a lineation of new line-breaks:
stops that defy
even the physics of refraction,
thoughts that now re-surface
and resurrect just as
passion and reverence did
within the folds of The Prophet.
2
It is still mid-afternoon,
the blue blaze makes the pages
of my book flip over gently
in the invisible wind of silence.
The heat penetrating the glass
focuses even more fiercely
smoking out redolent similes,
questioning the whole point,
the nib of writing itself.
Underneath the permanent scar
of jet-black fluid and heat
is pulp, half-dead.
Beneath the persistent hoarse-
drone of metal-scratching
is bleached pulp, half-alive,
its cotton laid sheets
carefully encoded with
the magic arc of a gold-tip.
Words appear, and more
words. And under them all,
I discover much later,
a small spring insect
that lay mummified,
quietly crushed below
the weight of words,
its innocence and juice
trapped under oppression
of ambition and intellect,
baptised and bloodied.
3
It is mid-afternoon,
and I too lie, dead-
still, blanched, bloodied.

The Daisy follows soft the Sun—
And when his golden walk is done—
Sits shyly at his feet—
He—waking—finds the flower there—
Wherefore—Marauder—art thou here?
Because, Sir, love is sweet!
We are the Flower—Thou the Sun!
Forgive us, if as days decline—
We nearer steal to Thee!
Enamored of the parting West—
The peace—the flight—the Amethyst—
Night's possibility!

The Sun is not just a special star
Huge balls of hot gases are stars spinning in space
So big so hot and giving heat and light to the Earth
Larger than one million Earths is the Shining Sun in front of our face.
We must never look directly at the Sun
Cos it's not fun its brightness will damage the eyes
The Sun gives lives to all creatures on Earth
To all births, animals, human beings n natures when Sun shines
The stars shine all the time day and night
The Sun's so bright, it hides the light of the other stars
With a steady light's broken up as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere
Oh my dear, how beautiful they look, sparkle twinkle little stars.
The Earth spins or rotates on its axis
In geographic, we have...night and day, who wonder how?
The axis is an...imaginary line, going through the centre of the Earth
Taking 24 hours at once for the Earth to spin around.
At night, one side of the Earth moves away from the Sun
That part is the darkness..as the sun seems to sink below
Look at the horizon, the darkness is starting filling the dawn sky
With the rich dark beautiful colours, changing to night time very very slow.

The sun sets in molten gold.
The evening clouds form a jade disk.
Where is he?
Dense white mist envelops the willows.
A sad flute plays “Falling Plum Blossoms.”
How many Spring days are left now?
This Feast of Lanterns should be joyful.
The weather is calm and lovely.
But who can tell if it
Will be followed by wind and rain?

There you were
So distant from my life
Yet so near in my eyes
I hear your one special laugh
Yet you're weeping inside
But you're no ordinary soul
Coz you can touch someone's life (with your smile)
I know
You're heart's been badly hurt
But you still shines like the sun
In the sky
Chorus:
I wish that I could be there (and be your friend)
So you don't have to pretend (that you're okay)
if things don't feel alright (never alright)
Just let me be by your side
I'll wipe your tears dry
When the sun starts to cry
You sang a song
So full of emotions
It made everybody cry
But do they know
What lies behind your song
A sad story just like mine
I know
You ain't that strong
As they all know
But still you're here
Just to shine
A light in our sky
(Repeat Chorus)
Bridge:
You were just a stranger
I see everyday
But you gave me that warmth
I rarely feel on people
These days
But why do you need to hide
The rain beneath your clouds
You know, you don't have to pretend
When you're feeling
Down, down, down
So why don't you just look around
(Repeat Chorus)
When the sun starts to cry
(Repeat until fade)

Watching my Granddaughter at her swimming lessons,
she's just awesome!
Having learned how to swim when she was a year old,
now going off the low dive and the high dive.
No fear within her, just loving the adrenaline rush,
much like her Grandma does.
Now having competitions with other kids in swimming
lessons.

How nice to swim in sea, river, lake and pond!
Floating body, pressing water, moving forward
How nice to enjoy spattering, splashing sound!
Gesturing body, flapping wing, clapping hand,
I remember once while swimming with friend
To cross the local river to go to enjoy local band
Where we saw the singers sang hand in hand
In sweet voice, shaking body, hair, opening mind,
On the way home longitudinally in river we swam
All the while we gossiped and made lots of fun
Then we dove, caught fishes, late we returned home
Many happy did return in every sun and moon,
Now, we swim paying money in swimming pool
And in artificial lake without lily though waterful
But funless swimming, charmless time passing
Though it is a game here with heavy contesting.

I always believed
that the russian president
who achieved
so much in the present
would be a man
with huge intelligence
and a great human
making a difference,
but now I throw my hands in horror
and all my faith yields to sorrow
how can they build a nuclear reactor
swimming on a boat to the pole
and instead of being a protector
taking business as a destruction goal
why setting million lives in peril
just to get fossil fuels to use
where the waves might kill
by the natural abuse
what kind of weird driving element
in a money making hand
conclusion of this all
the brain is small
the greed is tall

anyone for swim window sea diving
dive through house blue window frame
into ripple blue sea changes inviting
a lot of thoughts to hide in dive in
in a plus green personal library chair
among a sea of book thoughts unread
stairs to the sky stars universe beyond
start with inlaid luminous ceramic tiles
yin yang in black paua shell contrasts

On this special Eve
I swim with my four grand kids
Under cloudy sky.
They have a good time
They enjoy talking while swimming
They race many times.
I swim on my back
So I can watch moonlit sky
And three-quarter-moon.
Silver lining clouds
Keep changing shapes and lines
Never look alike.
This is Summer time
Fire worms have dates on my yard
Frogs croak in Koi pond.
In fresh warm water
On Independence Day Eve
We have lots of fun.

If anyone can not swim very well, then                                 Drowning will be inevitable                                           Simply because we can not have any fun                                With any ocean,                                                       With any sea, or                                                       With any river anytime, anywhere, and everywhere...                    Only able-bodied swimmer can manage                                   Any kind of swimming with long time experiences...                   We all love to swim, but                                               Well-trained people can escape...                                 _________________________________________________ ____________________

Lovers who want to make successful lives
always compromise
I have since years gone by
always said Yes
never No
who am I to stop the freedom
of the one I love
even animals are blessed so
love each other when you flow
and
let go when charms don't glow
and both know
Very beautifully conveyed
love all day and night
him
you may
till life's last days
letwater flow in the rivers
of where live you may
and entwined
for life do stay
God Bless such lovers like you
always

There is a swimming pool in a small town
where water sparkles as blue as the sky,
where some bikini clad girls draw the eye,
with skin tanned to mahogany brown,
where from a diving board people dive down,
where time gets wings and quickly rushes by.
There is a swimming pool in a small town
where water sparkles as blue as the sky,
where a myriad of beautiful girls daily lie,
where the garden is somewhat overgrown
and children buy sweets, chips and pie,
while teens frolic until the sun does die.
There is a swimming pool in a small town
where water sparkles as blue as the sky.

If, in the month of dark December,
Leander, who was nightly wont
(What maid will not the tale remember?)
To cross thy stream, broad Hellespont!
If, when the wintry tempest roar'd,
He sped to Hero, nothing loth,
And thus of old thy current pour'd,
Fair Venus! how I pity both!
For me, degenerate modern wretch,
Though in the genial month of May,
My dripping limbs I faintly stretch,
And think I've done a feat today.
But since he cross'd the rapid tide,
According to the doubtful story,
To woo, -- and -- Lord knows what beside,
And swam for Love, as I for Glory;
'Twere hard to say who fared the best:
Sad mortals! thus the gods still plague you!
He lost his labour, I my jest;
For he was drown'd, and I've the ague.

Form: Vertical Monocrostic

Three days after the first snowfall of season
The air is calm, but lots of hanging clouds.
Snow falls, but just few scattered flakes.
The sun is half-hiding behind passing clouds.
A squirrel lies by roadside with exposed belly.
This squirrel was killed last night, while crossing the road.
Few years, I traveled this road, back and forth
Many times, I was afraid that this squirrel might be struck dead.
The other day, I pushed my car break to a sudden stop.
This squirrel was standing in the middle of the road,
Too scared, it ran in circle, not sure of where to escape.
It escaped its death because of its best luck.
Last night, this squirrel was struck.
I feel sad and miss you much
Have my sympathy, my dear squirrel.

Love, sympathy and respect is a sign of greatness! - Joshua Aaron Guillory

Ageing Bella in the house at the corner outdoors she is not often seen
She was a potential swimming Olympian till a motoring accident she had at eighteen
Brought an end to her swimming career back in ninteen seventy three
And condemned her to life in a wheelchair she does deserve great sympathy.
She could not compete in the Olympics and swim her way into renown
And become the toast of the Nation and the heroine of her Hometown
It robbed her of her chance of having children she has never been any man's wife
one might say she was quite unlucky that accident ruined her life.
She is quite an attractive woman her brown hair flecked with strands of gray
She had spent years of her life in a wheelchair seven to ten years before her prime day
when I meet her she smiles and says hello but sometimes she looks rather sad
I can only empathize with her a terrible life she has had.
Thirty six of her fifty four years in a wheelchair since her widowed mum died five years ago she has lived on her own
Lady luck is surely against her a terrible life she has known
Confined to a wheelchair due to a car crash on the highway which robbed her of her chance of fame
In swimming she was a young champion and for herself making a name.

He lives in the outer parts never seen by high society.
Always hip on what the story is, he’s broke without a penny.
Filled with messages from the broken hearts, he knows their plight in the entirety.
Got the grip on every politic, he just wished there wasn’t any.
Robin Hood waiting for Marion, could it be that
all the good in the world’s is done.
It was everyone’s big wish we could find the shining sun.
I pray to God His staff and rod will guide us.
Lost forgotten is our man of arms, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG.
He’s kicked and mocked and trampled on, empathy for the underdog.
He stands for Don Quixote’s song, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG.
He hides in the forest deep with a rabbit amidst the wilds.
Gone away from all the world like ours to meditate upon it.
Filled with answers but shy he will keep till the moment is ripe and mild.
Every ear will turn and listen as He recites His lovely sonnets.
There he stood singing His passion’s song, could it be that
all the good has turned to wrong?
It was many days until a gong whence rang amongst this throng.
I summon God to pass along His wisdom.
Lost forgotten is our man of arms, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG.
He’s kicked and mocked and trampled on, empathy for the underdog.
He stands for Don Quixote’s song, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG.
Like a lightning bolt His Word will strike.
Shaking mountains and bursting dykes
flowing out upon a troubled world.
His soul will shine like a morning star.
My heart will be there for Him
always faithful through thick and thin
and justice will be rendered then
and hope will reach the dark and grim.
Lost forgotten is our man of arms, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG.
He’s kicked and mocked and trampled on, empathy for the underdog.
He stands for Don Quixote’s song, SYMPATHY FOR THE UNDERDOG.

Therefore I dare reveal my private woe,
The secret blots of my imperfect heart,
Nor strive to shrink or swell mine own desert,
Nor beautify nor hide. For this I know,
That even as I am, thou also art.
Thou past heroic forms unmoved shalt go,
To pause and bide with me, to whisper low:
"Not I alone am weak, not I apart
Must suffer, struggle, conquer day by day.
Here is my very cross by strangers borne,
Here is my bosom-sin wherefrom I pray
Hourly deliverance--this my rose, my thorn.
This woman my soul's need can understand,
Stretching o'er silent gulfs her sister hand."

In the darkly lit room
Hangs the smell of doom
As he babbles about his eyes
He seems bent on a mission
To paint a bleak vision
His elation isn’t disguised!
I’ve them aplenty
My eyes bloodied
In surgeon’s needles
Retinal detachment
Cataract
Glaucoma
There isn’t a trauma
My eyes haven’t suffered
His eyeballs roll
On the sclera
In perverse pleasure
I don’t mind
If I go blind,
The misery around
Doesn’t make eyesight a treasure
I haven’t met a man
To himself this inhuman
Treating the most valued lens
With such immense disdains
More than my suffering eyes
He says in glee undisguised
I suffer your cruelty,
That’s when you say
It’s my way
To garner sympathy!

Where is the voice in my head
If any help it wants to be
now would be the best
These hands which flawlessly curse me
perform a symphony of sympathy
a one man orchestra of confusion and heartbreak
Where is this trust I've heard so much about
but can't seem to find
And to the world in which I stay
don't hate me when I say
'This identical state of mind
from the glass we look through
can you locate the hopes of the citizens
you erase
You know our names and our faces
but could you take one look at a blooming blue rose
straight in the eye and call it ugly
Could you look at a hummingbird
and ask for its wings to cease it's beat
We are the angels of this life
All we need is our wings
so could you help me find mine
the ones I lost some time ago

A person is called saint if he has kindness with all the sympathy
He can claim then only as direct descendent of almighty
Or Messiah, messenger or for that respect an angel
At every inch you must look ordinary but with different angle
I have known or heard about many of such figures
They have worked for the humanity and reassured
About the human misery and risk involved for apathy
What work is to be taken up or followed to gain His sympathy?
Each work is evaluated and appreciated by God
Many might have lost favor as their soul stands sold
They are burden and living animal on earth
At each stage they live on but with the fear of death
To work under such difficult situation is Herculean task
No one may opt for it or readily go and ask
Some of the great souls are easily picked on earth
God has always created such situation without any dearth
Such a kind of saints have prevailed in present time
For the rescue of mankind with their known and committed crimes
Hardly anybody can undertake such enterprise
It is much to relief and to our surprise
It proves God's existence
We feel and experience His presence
He is omni present and in every individual
Only we fail to understand Him and take very casual
If some one works on charity or any kind of human service
That may be counted as noble cause and looked upon very nice
All kinds of help will be rendered and efforts lauded
His or her presence will be taken with high esteem and applauded
It is not done to gain international fame
It may involve great work and full of blames
Little slackness may invite lots of criticism
As it isli9nked with the work of humanism
Thousands of hands are raised in your well being
Prayers and congregations are held to praise and sing
Preaching is done so as to spread the kind and love message
The sick and ill fated souls are shown the way with passage
The services of poor may be remembered very long
It is not only the care and help but to stay among
Not showing mere finger for any work to be done
The far reaching impact will never be undone
Some of the names may be remembered by all
As they have responded with charity and humanitarian call
Anybody could do it without any assistance
But it has made some difference with their presence

All year I had behaved,
with not a friggin' hair
or sound of dissonance
in sight for those who looked.
But on that faithful morning
when certain feelings landed
inside the courtyard of that
what you would call the autonomic
and the system without limits,
it happened, and it did so quickly.
No rescue or reprieve, no hiding grace,
it's what they label 'in the act', that counts
he was my best and most benevolent
impressed with me, Herr Teacher.
How could one, ever, forget the shame,
that had attached itself by then
to one's own innocent and altruistic name?
I sometimes think that my mistakes,
my ludicrous misjudgments could well be
a measure of the me who would not even know.

bumped into my grandson's English teacher yesterday
at the football, and in between shouting like teenagers
I moaned about the state of A's Eng. Lit. not to mention Eng. Lang. -
you know, you've heard it all before... in my day.....never regretted....
he agreed, but said go easy on the lad he's only thirteen
they all want to be fifteen and grown up at that age,
they can't be seen by their peer-group to be 'for' anything too much
so they ridicule everything, it's either pretentious crap if it's modern
or stupid ancient crap if it's more than a generation ago...
they even call Shakespeare a sad loser until
someone says he wrote the screenplay for that film
though they're fascinated by the idea that Marlowe
was a spy as well as a crap writer not that they've read him anyway
but you know what he said
put them up on stage in the annual Shakespeare and make them
speak his lines, and they'll never forget it,
they'll not say anything about it to me except in private but
they'll remember it to their dying day it's things like that
he said that keep me in this bloody job.

I love my teacher
He is full of life
I love my teacher
He doesn't cause any strife
I love my teacher
For he is full of light
I love my teacher
He is always bright
I love my teacher
For he doesn't get in a fight
And, I love my teacher
For he tells me to look on the side that's bright

my teacher ate my homework,
which i thought was rather odd.
he sniffed at it and smiled,
and gave a thoughtful chew.
I think he must have liked it,
for he really went to town.
He licked off all his fingers,
gave a burp and said, 'You pass.'
I guess that's how they grade you
when you're in a cooking class.

Teacher, teacher, teacher,
you don't be a preacher,
and never be a searcher,
I will become a researcher,
Madame always I mischief,
Still, you give relief,
Never you have punished,
If work not finished,
Class, always I miss,
Make I noise hiss,
I get up and ask miss,
Making nuisance for a piss,
You still not get angry,
Allow me to go if feel hungry,
I have a good rapport,
With your full support,
The whole day I play,
Mingle with dirt and also clay,
Still, I pass it as a good day,
No lessons are done and books at bay,
I will be clever and also naughty,
But never I trouble when feeling thirsty,
Learn the lessons by heart,
Make effort double to look smart,
I may not care and also respect,
Teacher and senior when they inspect,
Still, you never mention to my parents,
Never put remarkAnd also prevent,
Still, I not realize and continue to grow,
If a teacher isnot around whistle I blow,
Still, I find love and enough care,
Not good at study and not aware,
Should I fare badly never do a mail?
Papa and mummy may rush by rail,
They will take me home if I fail,
Put me in the room to serve in jail,
I make you a promise to be a good boy,
Learn and work hard and never make ploy,
My parents may get angry and not offer toy
So teacher please you not make them annoy

Here's the rule for what to do
If ever your teacher has the flu
Or for some other reason takes to her bed
And a different teacher comes instead
When the visiting teacher hangs up her hat
Writes the date on the board, does this or that
Always remember, you have to say this,
OUR teacher never does that, Miss!
When you want to change places or wander about
Or feel like getting the guinea pig out
Never forget, the message is this,
OUR teacher always lets us, Miss!
Then, when your teacher returns next day
And complains about the paint or clay
Remember these words, you just say this:
That OTHER teacher told us to, Miss!

Oh my teacher...
let me praise you,
for you sprouted me out,
from a darkened life.
Oh my teacher...
show me -
your magical spirit..
by which you made-
the darkness to light.
oh my teacher...
let me thank you...
for which you, quenched my thirst-
for knowledge.
My teacher...,
thank you...
for you took out-
words from my throat-
and you showed me to-
make finest garland,
by those words...
My teacher...
you showed me,
the stars....
pointing up the sky..,
saying 'its stars...-
..shining stars...
..glittering..., twinkling...'
My teacher...
it's because of you,
i loved butterflies...,
and green grasshoppers..!
and it's because of you..
that i have,
dreams; unending.
My teacher..
i am always
indebted....for your deeds..
for the lifeline..
which you -
in my forehead!
My teacher....,
ne'er let your lamp-
to be gone into darkness.
My teacher...
this is for you...
dedicated with..,
sincere respect.

We played at the park that afternoon
She chased a football, wagging her tail
And barking at the local kids who
Laughed and called her 'sausage dog'
That evening she stumbled on the stairs
And whimpered when I picked her up
By midnight she was shivering with shock
The vet diagnosed herniated disc
Next day she was paralyzed and incontinent
The specialist was aloof and kept us waiting
Suggested surgery and wouldn't guarantee it
His fee was two thousand dollars.  We said no
The breeder said 'Give old George a ring'
George Schofield, chiropractor for dogs
Eighty-four years old.  Works from home
In an open fronted shed.  Charges ten dollars.
George Schofield, a nugget of a man
With stumpy fingers and heart of gold
Adjusted her spine and performed a miracle
In seven days, my dog was walking

Ruthlessly the judgement was pronounced
A shameful death sentence
To be carried out at the place of a skull
For all to see and mock him
Despite his innocence, clearly proved beyond all doubt
Despite his goodness to all and sundry
Despite his love to everyone
This judgement was upheld by all
But with joy in his heart he embraced his death
So that the will of he, who sent him, may be fulfilled
So that all, including his execusioners, will be reconcilled to the creator
So that no soul will be lost
This is a sacrifice that is beyond all sacrifice
A sacrifice of life which was exceptional
Lord Jesus Christ, Thanks For Your Sacrifice

This is my 2000th poem,
though not all are posted here.
A lot of my early work
just failed to pass the test of time
and have been left locked away.
I always told myself that when I reached 2000
I would retire from poetry.
At least for a while.
I have other writing projects
that need my urgent attention
so I am saying a special thanks
to all those whom over the last two years
have read my poems
and left a comments here and there.
I also want to say thank you
to those who read my collaborations
with Jo Jo Bean and Meggie Gultiano
as Jo Jo Bean, Dodgy Dave and Meggie Gultiano,
and my alias Howard ‘Howie’ Johnson.
I say thank you to every one of you.
To say that I am leaving is not quit right;
I will still be reading and commenting
from time to time.
It is just that I will not be posting
for the foreseeable future.
Thank you once again for all the support
you have given me
and God Bless every one of you.

Thanks for playing with my feelings,
How i wish i could stop my heart from beating,
Thanks for playing with my heart,
At least to you this was a fun part,
you have left me broken, with my eyes filled with tears and fears,
At least you are whole, with smile on your face and not a sight of fear,
To you i was just a game, that you tried to win and succeeded,
Now that you are bored you've left me deserted,
Thanks for playing with my head,
Your sick little mind games,
You kept me guessing, till the very end,
Thanks for playing with my emotions,
According to you this was my weakness,
Thanks for your fake love,
Thanks for pretending that your cared,
Thanks for strengthening my belief, that LOVE is nothing but a pain causing pill,
Thanks for showing me that friendship is something that does not really exist,
Thanks for breaking my trust, for opening up, for sharing my thoughts, for placing my trust on an unknown soul,
Thanks for opening my eyes, you honestly showed me that Love too like friendship is something that does not actually exist,
Thanks for showing me the right path,
A path where to help is to hurt, to love is to lie, to share is to sin, to smile is a crime,
Thanks for showing me, a man with a heart is not a man at all,
Thanks for proving that I'm a fool, to have trusted you,
I will hate myself, till the very end, for loving you...........................

Thanks Lord for wipping our tears
Because our tears came down from our eyes
So fast while we had cried today

HER griefs were the hours
When my struggle was sore,--
Her joys were the powers
That the climber upbore.
Her home is the boundless
Free ocean that seems
To rock, calm and soundless,
My galleon of dreams.
Half hers are the glancing
Creations that throng
With pageant and dancing
The ways of my song.
My fires when they dwindle
Are lit from her brand;
Men see them rekindle
Nor guess by whose hand.
Of thanks to requite her
No least thought is hers,--
And therefore I write her,
Once, thanks in a verse.

I started out long ago
with a handful of dreams,
but through the years,
every one of them vanished
or so it seemed to me.
They say that chance
plays a big part in our lives,
and it was by chance
someone recognised me
from an old photograph
Now my dreams have returned
and slowly each are coming true.
Just as I turned away
from the road a head,
I have turned back to greater things.
Once I abandoned my life,
felt it was going nowhere.
Thanks to chance
I have found myself again
and a brighter future somewhere.

While reading these poems my heart wanted to cry
as the words and the meanings brought a tear to my eye
remembering the innocence of childhood
which I as a teen greatly misunderstood.
Plz do not stop pouring out youre heart
because in mine youre poems will always have a part.

Spring in my step
Spring in the air
Spring!
Spring!
Lingering everywhere.
Spring fever to follow,
But I don't care,
Spring, for new journeys,
I'll meet you there!
Where?
By the garden gate,
You silly thing,
It's an invitation to frolic
So let's begin to sing.
It's Spring!
Written first day of Spring 2010
Dorothy Alves Holmes
A Poet Who Loves To Sing

From time to time
The clouds give rest
To the moon beholders..

And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen?
And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark Satanic mills?
Bring me my bow of burning gold:
Bring me my arrows of desire:
Bring me my spear: O clouds unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire.
I will not cease from mental fight,
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land.

Cold and heat!
Winter and Summer;
The muse of life,
With the ways of nature! !
Seed time and harvest time.

Time or fate may separate friends, lovers,
But friendship or love that's true will ever
Thenceforth continue to live forever,
True love conquers the odd with its power.
As time passes by, things change with the time,
Every moment, hour, day, month, and year,
All things have their turn to change with the time,
Life, time, and events change with the years.
Everyone, everything, have a time and day,
A time to change, end, begin a new day,
Change is life, the course of life everyday,
All things change, and we change with them all days.
Only the Eternal one is constant,
All things in the universe, inconstant,
But despite it all, love is important,
The world may change, but true love is constant.

Time and time again
we rise and fall
like the tides
beyond our all
time and time again
we take never to give
like the seasons
our wants renew
time and time again
we live to die
like the rainbow
our whole life a lie

You teach me the art of life,
to endure the sudden strife.
Time, time, I love you very much.
I can't grow without your touch.

A birdie with a yellow bill
Hopped upon my window sill,
Cocked his shining eye and said:
"Ain't you 'shamed, you sleepy-head!"

Eternity is like unto a Ring.
Time, like to Measure, doth it self extend;
Measure commences, is a finite thing.
The Ring has no beginning, middle, end.

Today is a good day to be happy
The sun's brightly shinning,
Birds are gaily singing,
Negativity today, is not winning.
I'n not drowning in the tide,
i'm swiming with it -
like a fish,
yet, althought painful past's not dead,
No longer do i hear,
their criticising voices in my head.
Can't forget the past -
But i can forgive,
banish their wrongs,
They're locked in the dark,
everyday's a good day is how i will live,
and mending my scared heart
Is a great place to start.
1/11/05

An Easter flower cuts light into the sill
The sound of suffering is forever still.
Tears of forgiveness warm the evening chill.
I hear His whisper in a rustling leaf,
'I would have been so lonely in my grief,
Without your fragile friendship, my good thief.
You did not scorn the pity of My frame,
But saw the Jesus in Me just the same,
I call you Friend, you need no other name.
My Father's house is just a breath away.
See. one by one the windows light our way.
I think He was expecting us today.'
Beyond the drama of earth's dying skies,
Joy is too powerful for human eyes.
Forever is today in Paradise.
For my dear friend, Ralph Russell who often requested this poem to be read at Easter.

"Beep-beep.
BANKERS TRUST AUTOMOBILE LOAN
You'll find a banker at Bankers Trust"
Advertisement in N.Y. Times
When comes my second childhood,
As to all men it must,
I want to be a banker
Like the banker at Bankers Trust.
I wouldn't ask to be president
Or even assistant veep,
I'd only ask for a kiddie car
And permission to go beep-beep.
The banker at Chase Manhattan,
He bids a polite Good-day;
The banker at Immigrant Savings
Cries Scusi! and Olé!
But I'd be a sleek Ferrari
Or perhaps a joggly jeep,
And scooting around at Bankers Trust,
Beep-beep, I'd go, beep-beep.
The trolley car used to say clang-clang
And the choo-choo said toot-toot,
But the beep of the banker at Bankers Trust
Is every bit as cute.
Miaow, says the cuddly kitten,
Baa, says the woolly sheep,
Oink, says the piggy-wiggy,
And the banker says beep-beep.
So I want to play at Bankers Trust
Like a hippety-hoppety bunny,
And best of all, oh best of all,
With really truly money.
Now grown-ups dear, it's nightie-night
Until my dream comes true,
And I bid you a happy boop-a-doop
And a big beep-beep adieu.

I went home today
And it was a big surprise; Buildings got in the way
And made me realize I couldn't stay
Although I tried,
Old Friends could not be found
Like me, they all moved away
Home is not back there
But do you know where?
I went home today and much to my surprise
I found all the memories home inside
For in the heart
is the only place Home will stay
So I went home today

The racist cloaks his loathing thoughts
behind deceiving eyes
Those men who once wore hoods and robes
Today wear shirts and ties
Their methods changed but yet and still,
Their mission is the same
Today they lynch with politics,
the racist's favorite game
Divide and conquer is their plan
to keep minorities
From seeing that the forest lies
just shortly past the trees
Racism lurks within the press,
courthouses, banks and schools
Black folks convinced that all is well
have certainly been fooled
A racist underground exists,
a chilling fact indeed
They seek to kill, steal and destroy,
We can't let them succeed

Behold a beggar playing sad a tune!
By heart, on his own poor, old harmonium;
Though blind, he seems to be in God’s commune;
Alas! is this the new millennium?
Behold a lady working by hand-loom;
A widow poor, she has a female child!
Victim of consumption that spread to womb;
That turns all hearts of sympathy so wild.
Behold the handicapped who jobs the lathe!
With fore-limbs lost by accident, the smiles;
’Tis hard and dangerous; his sweat does bathe;
In dignity he lives and walks home miles.
And lo, the whole some man in car complains,
And curses all while driving drunk through lanes!

Today I looked at you
Studied every angle of your face
Your nose, your eyelashes, your mouth
I tried to engrave every inch of you into my mind
So I would not forget a single detail
I drank you in as you stood before me
Appearing completely oblivious of my stealing your essence
As I knew I would not see you
For a while

(inspired by John Latham's art, 'The N-U Niddrie Heart')
I  awoke in a stream of rays,
laid my Pregnant Survivor’s Manual
on the edge of the rug,
gave it a quick tug.
At the other end
I placed my book of Vanished Species,
then squatted in between,
gave myself a hug
and felt just like today.

We are writing today many verses
By command and grace of God,
By virtue and perseverance!
We are writing for God's service,
By his guidance in inner core,
For bringing transformation,
For cracking war and bringing peace,
We are writing today to transfer
The message of God in many poems,
You will read today and tomorrow!
Today we are writing, today you read,
Also tomorrow you read, read, and read,
For learning values and perspectives,
For developing inner beauty and personality,
When you uplift inner values and conscience
Automatically humanity shines with light,
You can decide what is right and wrong,
Expressing your selfless service towards all,
Carrying the values of divine empowerment,
Through love, peace and forgiveness you lead,
Godly knowledge helps you to recognize life.
Illusion cannot affect you if you are awakened,
Matters cannot bind you if you are detached,
Living life in attachment-free state you learn,
Every verse which carries God's message you read,
Name, fame, achievements, wealth and relationships,
All these things in material world are perishable,
At right time you acquire divine knowledge,
All those material things are related to body,
But you are soul different than body,
Finally when time of change comes,
You leave your body and form is changed,
Every material possession you leave behind
And it is destroyed in core of time!
Dear soul, you remain in awakened state.

We need not snow,
Or electrical glow.
It's not a matter of weather,
Because we're together.
We need not a 'magic',
Love's not in a gadget.
There's only one matter:
It's that we're together.
Need we the songs,
Or the movies that come on?
We've the best of what's better,
When we're together.
There's a look on our faces
That surely displaces
All the boxes and cases,
and the ribbon and laces.
It's the beauty of Together.
There's something about our time
That bears the fruit of the vine,
Making a sweeter wine.
The fingerprints of the Divine,
On the truth of Together.
When we've all gathered round,
And harken to the sound,
Of God's presence all around,
The perfect setting being found...
We're Together.

What we use to do.
And what we now can find no time,
Together.
Chasing rainbows once done!
Neglecting the Sunrays...
To prefer sitting under clouds,
Expecting rain and thunder to come!
Did we welcome that?
And when did it begin?
I wish what we use to do,
Could return back to us again!
But that would mean,
We would have to forgive and forget!
And revive the love,
That swept us off our feet.
And remove the dirt...
Kept swept under the rug!
Can we together,
Chase rainbows once done?
Or are we here...
To victimize each other's dreams?

I am glad you came into my life
At a time when I was lugubrious
And full with so much doleness
At times when I am feeling blue
All I have to do is just call you
but restrain
To tell you what's on my mind!
I like it when you see at me
Or to just play with my pen
to pen you a word
We spend so much time apart from each other
So now we can finally be together.

Why does mankind hate people based on religion and race?
Is it ignorance, education, or governments deciding our place.
For people are people regardless of the color of their face.
And the love in our hearts is an example of God's grace.
European people are the most powerful people under the sun.
Asians, Blacks, and Jews are constantly under the economic gun.
But people should not be exploited because of the color of skin.
White people must reject racism for a world of love to begin.
But are not Blacks, Jews, and Asians also guilty of racism?
For some of their religious leaders are advocates of separatism.
Now all people, whites, Asians, Jews,and Blacks, live on earth.
For racism will show God how much our souls are really worth.
All people will die and their bodies will stink becoming dirt.
And the devil will have the souls of all racist to forever hurt.
For Love is the most powerful force throughout the world.
Conquering all obstacles and causing racist minds to whirl.
We can't take money religion family or hate when we die.
But we can take love, and send it back to those who will cry.
For only love will cure any grieving and lonely heart.
And cause a no-good son or daughter to give life another start.
People are just human beings regardless of their ethnic pride.
So people should try to constantly look spiritually inside.
So forget about religion racism and discriminating government.
Because only Brotherhood will eliminate all bills and the rent.

Sleeping together... how tired you were...
How warm our room... how the firelight spread
On walls and ceiling and great white bed!
We spoke in whispers as children do,
And now it was I--and then it was you
Slept a moment, to wake--"My dear,
I'm not at all sleepy," one of us said....
Was it a thousand years ago?
I woke in your arms--you were sound asleep--
And heard the pattering sound of sheep.
Softly I slipped to the floor and crept
To the curtained window, then, while you slept,
I watched the sheep pass by in the snow.
O flock of thoughts with their shepherd Fear
Shivering, desolate, out in the cold,
That entered into my heart to fold!
A thousand years... was it yesterday
When we two children of far away,
Clinging close in the darkness, lay
Sleeping together?... How tired you were....

This road is always an easy road at the beginning,
but time has a funny way of turning things around. The
passion and the love you have for life, you still have,
but I just never saw it, till it was too late. Time has a strange way of healing. The years have now
passed and for some reason, destiny has brought us back
together. Why! There is a reason for this, I don't know
why but, I wouldn't question it. It's now your turn for happiness and for receiving
that gift of peace and love, for your years of giving.
My love, the light now shines through my window. I see
the light shining, I can see the lake of peace, which will
now be calm and serene for us both. For till time finally stands still, I will be here for
you and never to abandon you, as long as we are together. So till the end of time, I will be yours.

When I see the world, for you
When you became the world to me
A rainbow arched beyond the storms
To green pastures of destiny
Where our paths converge
As if God Himself determined
That this was the time
That we had walked enough alone
On those sad and winding roads
When I see the world, for you
By you, this is now a beautiful place
In the sun that parts the darkened clouds
In the presence of His grace
Your hand in my hand, together
We face the uncharted horizon
Of hope, of promise, of love
That God's gift of time is ours to share
As we walk by the calm and shimmering sea
Down the glorious road now set before us
Onward to eternity

It is very hard for me
To piece together a hundred dreams
That belongs to different people

I plunk at a beach,
silence herein,
I am, bit by bit,
shredded by winds
I pause all alone,
nowhere to go,
as if I were lost,
in a crossroad
Fall on my knees,
and it is you I see
dancing gracefully
in a place I can't be
Flash before me,
our memories,
I close my eyes
and it's I perceive,
But, piece by piece,
those memories,
fading away,
leaving me at a bay
Silence hurts me,
tears me apiece
but inside my heart,
there goes a story
won't ever last,
though my body
is torn apiece
by winds before me....
'All of our trance,
won't ever end
Until we can dance,
together again'

bayon smiles
from high up
a thousand year old smile
preserved through the ages
in the forests
snarled, overgrown
with shrubs, ferns
to finally emerge and
smile again triumphantly
well, thank god, for the dim years
the forest, has saved you
from marauding thais, chams
burmese, colonialists and world war criminals
bayon, smile, smile and smile to the world
in all angles.

There are many roads we travel
And probably most we leave behind
We continue to walk ahead of us
New fresh roads we want to find
And sometimes we wonder
If we took the best road we could
If we could erase them and start over
We often think perhaps we would
Some roads we travel often though
Off and on throughout the years
They get worn and sad and weary
And we shed so many tears
But we try to put them behind us
And trudge bravely on ahead
Trying very heard to not look back
But find great new roads instead
So no matter where we’ve been
As our lives we continue to unravel
We all just try to do our best
With the many roads we travel!

Vieques, a small island just a short ferry ride from San Juan, delivers the ideal beach vacation. Even with its picture-perfect scenery and pristine beaches, the island does not draw crowds—visitors will find that their footprints are often the only ones in the sand. Once the sun sets, head to Island Adventures Biobay Eco-tours for a guided swim in the bioluminescent Mosquito Bay, where every splash and kick will create a silver flash in the dark water

The railroad track is miles away,
And the day is loud with voices speaking,
Yet there isn't a train goes by all day
But I hear its whistle shrieking.
All night there isn't a train goes by,
Though the night is still for sleep and dreaming,
But I see its cinders red on the sky,
And hear its engine steaming.
My heart is warm with friends I make,
And better friends I'll not be knowing;
Yet there isn't a train I wouldn't take,
No matter where it's going.

One of these are  the unimaginable intricate  ivory carvings that make one wonder how ancient craftsmen could craft a Chinese poem with a hundred words on a space not larger than a square inch. Also
men and women the size of a few rice grains with intricate facial expressions. This writer does not encourage ivory carvings though.

I’m no slave, yet you pit me here.
The verge of death's grave.
To sleep, weep in the mudded dirt.
You take away my body’s tattered shirt.
I’m no slave, you wretched tyrant.
You loud- mouthed, fat- bellied master.
It is not you, whom I fear, no.
It’s the Lord above, who sent me here.
He sent me to this troubled land.
To stand  ground, dig deep my soul.
It is he whom I fear  most of all.
Without him, I will never stand tall.
Take what you will, beat me as you must.
I will endure, to the Lord I give my trust.

So dont let others control your life and do your best to succed in what you do.

Live for what you love
Love what you trust
Trust what you live for
OR
Live for what you trust
Trust what you love
Love the way you live
OR
Live your life to the point of no return
Love the world for what it's worth
Trust those closest to your heart

When shattered seems the Lamp of Life in me;
And broken lies the glass-mantle of fame;
My body's wick too half-burnt and sadly;
Heart's fuel gone, in hopelessness and shame!
I ponder if these are my earth's last days,
As weary lie my spirit and my will;
While Death's cold-sneer is laughing at my face;
I feel miserable, so extremely ill!
The God in me goads me to carry on;
For earth's verdicts are not infallible;
New Hope could come with every morning's Dawn;
Nothing to God is ev'r impossible!
I continue to live as God demands,
He holds my hour-glass and its falling-sands!

Deep trust in God—for that I still have sought
Through all the grim doubts that bemock the soul,
When in the amazement of far-reaching throught,
We list the labourings that for ever roll
Like dubious thunders through those clouded regions
Where night and destiny the counsels keep
Of Time developing his shadowy legions.
And when I ve stood upon some hazardous steep
Of speculation—heaving up its bare
And rugged ridge high in the nebulous air
Of endless change, and thence tremendously
Throwing its shadow, like a blind man’s stare,
Out through the dread unknown—deep trust in Thee,
O God! Hath likewise been my refuge there.

Trust me with your pain
I promise I'll take nothing in vien
Trust me with you heart
I promise I'll never part
Trust me with your soul
I promise I'll never let you go
Trust me enough to let your guard down
i promise it'll only make me love you more
Trust me and
I promise

Chugging train at a station stops
Passengers hop
Passengers Shop
Baggage is dropped
In dingy passages darkness gropes
Meandering through some clammy slopes
Trust delivered on time in tranches
Like autumn’s bare branches
Balancing act at the stop
String of tears water a crop
Another time another sop
One more shop
Whistler signals carry you on
On the fly another pawn
Another dawn
Frenzied throes of compulsive lust
Blocked by trust?
Blown to dust?
Not just…stay!
But no on the trodden, well worn way;
another stop if I may!
Gloom beset and gathering doom.
Cannot you be in a shared room!
Its just…only a lonely tomb
Trust is but a bubble thing;
a silent burst, just a hollow ring.
Baleful swallow in a cemetery twitters.
Profane an hushed silence glitters.
No more views an no more cues.
Time to alight an pay your dues

After G-d, trust yourself the most.
Believe in yourself more than in others.
Always be confident, but forever humble.
Know who is who and what is what.
Close friends are the critical ones.
Gold has its value,
But life is priceless.
Stones are precious,
But never more than a parent's love.
Each day attempt to unlock the door to wisdom
With the key that is your mind.
Be comfortable with yourself,
And you will never be alone.

Imagine yourself -
yourself, to imagine –
this dream; dream
this imaging:
the water’s so far, far below
it’s beyond this dark imagining, this dream;
all your attention is required
by this rope bridge,
swayed by nature to some immediate, vibrating laws
of this way, that way, more complex
than steel or concrete bear in mind –
five lines of rope, that’s all,
bound from time to time
but only every few and fearful steps
so that they do not part
unless you tread without remembering
all five of them; toe, heel, as you place your foot…
and now it seems, in the illogical
precision of this dream – which is in
league with some dark inner truth
and so, it must be walked – now,
it’s not five ropes, any more,
but five strings of some instrument
vibrating, low and high; while tense, taut mind
looks for firm frets to tune each step;
or can you trust their tuning?
is the tuning now the fingers of your feet?
each fallible or faulty foothold
will send its string’s own warning of uncertainty:
this bass string, booming failure between the valley’s two high cliffs;
this treble string, nerve-searing scream of pain;
ahead, this firm support that holds the strings, now
drops away; the hollow soundbox that’s all space,
all sound, all air, all touch and light and flow of sound;
the sound of judgment’s stern and justly-tempered final chord –
now you awake: relieved, yet with a question,
born of night, to be resolved by day;
what does the dream tell to the waking thought?
what does the waking thought tell of the dream?
some metaphor for life inhabited your dream;
some knowledge passed, wrapped in a metaphor;
you only know, that it was watched – by whom?

If you believe in God
God must have made us all
Out of whatever God is
Unless God borrowed something small
From some other God, perhaps a friend of his
Or, he may have had a brother or a sister or two
Though this is unlikely and probably not true
Because it would mean, that he was in that case
Just one of  two or three Gods out there in space
Raising the question of who was there first
Where did the others come from?
Perhaps near Chislelhurst?
And then one could ask, where did the others go?
But that's a very difficult question to answer, you know
Which means in the end  you surely must perceive
If you believe in one God
He is in you and me
For whatever God is
You is a part
(Actually, ... I think, ....he lives in your heart)

As God is truth,
And truth is God,
The truth about God
Is that truth cannot lie;
And lies cannot become the truth,
For, God is truth,
And truth is God.
Copyright by Dr John Celes 4-27-2008

Truth be told, in days of old
You were the one I wanted to have and to hold
If it be, Boy cant you see
That you will always belong to me
As it is, and forever more,
If it's God's will that you walk out the door
Before you go, there is one thing you should know
That is, I will always love you so

I bought a dollar and a half's worth of small red potatoes,
took them home, boiled them in their jackets
and ate them for dinner with a little butter and salt.
Then I walked through the dried fields
on the edge of town.  In middle June the light
hung on in the dark furrows at my feet,
and in the mountain oaks overhead the birds
were gathering for the night, the jays and mockers
squawking back and forth, the finches still darting
into the dusty light.  The woman who sold me
the potatoes was from Poland; she was someone
out of my childhood in a pink spangled sweater and sunglasses
praising the perfection of all her fruits and vegetables
at the road-side stand and urging me to taste
even the pale, raw sweet corn trucked all the way,
she swore, from New Jersey.  "Eat, eat" she said,
"Even if you don't I'll say you did."
Some things
you know all your life.  They are so simple and true
they must be said without elegance, meter and rhyme,
they must be laid on the table beside the salt shaker,
the glass of water, the absence of light gathering
in the shadows of picture frames, they must be
naked and alone, they must stand for themselves.
My friend Henri and I arrived at this together in 1965
before I went away, before he began to kill himself,
and the two of us to betray our love.  Can you taste
what I'm saying?  It is onions or potatoes, a pinch
of simple salt, the wealth of melting butter, it is obvious,
it stays in the back of your throat like a truth
you never uttered because the time was always wrong,
it stays there for the rest of your life, unspoken,
made of that dirt we call earth, the metal we call salt,
in a form we have no words for, and you live on it.

This is the truth
I have betrayed you
This is the truth
I have lied to you
This is the truth
I feel no remorse
This is the truth
I will do it again
or
Is this the truth?
It meant nothing!
Is this the truth?
Please believe me
Is this the truth?
I am truly sorry
Is this the truth?
It won't happen again
or
The truth is this
I was a bit bored
The truth is this
Just a bit of fun
The truth is this
I got caught out
The truth is this
I'm only human

The time is now
Let change begin,
Blend heaven and earth
In an endless spin,
Wherever you're going,
Wherever you've been
Now change your direction
And travel within;
The time is now
To take a good look
Examine your life
And the roads that you took,
From cover to cover
You've written your book
Did you swim in the river
Or sleep by the brook?
The time is now
Get your head on straight
No more indecision
To love or to hate,
Since you are the author
Don't blame it on Fate,
Take control of your future
Before it's too late.

Truth is truth and it is the greatest work force
Truth is truth and it is the greatest religion
Truth is truth and it is the only essence of life
Truth is truth and it is all over the universe
Truth is truth and it is the greatest fighter here.

To see, or not to see, that is the problem;
Whether 'tis easier in this life to suffer
The barbs and jabs of unthinking citizens,
Or to marshal your forces against your foes,
And by resisting stop them? To struggle to weep;
No more; and by struggle to say to assuage
The heartache and the thousand inward struggles
That man is heir to, 'tis culmination
Fervently to be desired. To struggle to weep;
To weep; maybe to think: ay, there's the rub;
For in the weeping that drowns the sorrow
When you succumb to life here on earth,
Must present our cause; There's truth's impact
That makes chaos of so long a life;
For who is left to bear the taunts and jibes of time,
The abuser of power, the educators pleas,
The pangs of trampled truth, the endless trails,
The decisions in smoke filled rooms and the cries
Of those unworthy to think.
Truth will out! Truth will out!
But what is to be, will be.
Just what is transpiring at the Congressional level in our government! I thought that this poem might be worth considering.

Within themselves, they hold
more than any man or woman should be asked to hold;
they are the unsung heroes of the peace
which clutches at the coat-tails of a war;
and we can never truly know them;
only offer them love, support, respect…
My first school had been an officers’ recuperation hospital
or final hospice for the wounded – in their body or their mind -
in the 1914-18 war; now
the dignified head doctor of few words
and his beautifully-mannered, voluptuous
ex-head-nurse wife
had made of it an ideal, loving school
for the new children of a new era after
‘the war to end all wars’…
The last resting place of warriors with screaming silent minds
who could not recuperate or
who found death so much more peaceful than their life
became, first the art room,
then the chapel: death, art, God and life
all together in one room.
My second school had as its teaching staff
several ex-officers who had chosen to shroud their memories
in teaching that new generation; but ironically,
were asked to run the cadet force which was
intended to preserve that lovely peace..
the sergeant-major who taught us PT and defensive war
had a face that was a repulsive souvenir –
like camouflage – brown, red, livid white,
almost the yellow-green of mustard gas
that had painted war upon him;
though he saved his lungs…
fine, stern, stiff-upper-lip teachers
shrouding their memories, until
some pupil tested them too far –
then their anger spilled, their canes and swagger-sticks
fiercely wielded, were memories for those (not us)    who knew,
of discipline that might shoot at dawn
for the sake of lives then saved at dusk…
today, they’d be hauled into court for passing on 'abuse';
we were taught by heroes.
My third school gave me a housemaster,
another unsung, unsinging hero, a confirmed bachelor
so we thought, who likewise buried unknown memories
in devoted teaching; few clues except
the same occasional, devastating temper when aroused;
in his modest study, a few small
muzzy photos in silver frames, of comrades – dead or alive?
or did it matter? In his late fifties or even early sixties,
some inner torment of his memories transcended,
he surprised us all by marrying happily and producing
a large family. And once again, we had little clue
about the war he fought; or whether the nights
brought him tormented dreams…
We were taught by heroes who were asked to hold
more than any man or woman should be asked to hold:
do we wish – or should we wish –
that we knew then what we guess now?
They, teaching us from all their memories of hideous war,
how to grow up in peace; only to see
a generation of those same boys and girls
demanded by another war..
Autumn again; brown leaves fall like green lives;
soon, November mists and poppies
red as blood, red as children’s blood
from a terrible union, of heroism and futility
called war.

I
Last year I called this world of gain-givings
The darkest thinkable, and questioned sadly
If my own land could heave its pulse less gladly,
So charged it seemed with circumstance whence springs
The tragedy of things.
II
Yet at that censured time no heart was rent
Or feature blanched of parent, wife, or daughter
By hourly blazoned sheets of listed slaughter;
Death waited Nature's wont; Peace smiled unshent
From Ind to Occident.

NOUGHT more accursed in war I know
Than getting off scot-free;
Inured to danger, on we go
In constant victory;
We first unpack, then pack again,
With only this reward,
That when we're marching, we complain,
And when in camp, are bor'd.
The time for billeting comes next,--
The peasant curses it;
Each nobleman is sorely vex'd,
'Tis hated by the cit.
Be civil, bad though be thy food,
The clowns politely treat;
If to our hosts we're ever rude,
Jail-bread we're forced to eat.
And when the cannons growl around,
And small arms rattle clear,
And trumpet, trot, and drum resound,
We merry all appear;
And as it in the fight may chance,
We yield, then charge amain,
And now retire, and now advance,
And yet a cross ne'er gain.
At length there comes a musket-ball,
And hits the leg, please Heaven;
And then our troubles vanish all,
For to the town we're driven,
(Well cover'd by the victor's force,)
Where we in wrath first came,--
The women, frightened then, of course,
Are loving now and tame.
Cellar and heart are open'd wide,
The cook's allow'd no rest;
While beds with softest down supplied
Are by our members press'd.
The nimble lads upon us wait,
No sleep the hostess takes
Her shift is torn in pieces straight,--
What wondrous lint it makes!
If one has tended carefully
The hero's wounded limb,
Her neighbour cannot rest, for she
Has also tended him.
A third arrives in equal haste,
At length they all are there,
And in the middle he is placed
Of the whole band so fair!
On good authority the king
Hears how we love the fight,
And bids them cross and ribbon bring,
Our coat and breast to dight.
Say if a better fate can e'er
A son of Mars pursue!
'Midst tears at length we go from there,
Beloved and honour'd too.

Memorial day for the war dead.  Add now
the grief of all your losses to their grief,
even of a woman that has left you.  Mix
sorrow with sorrow, like time-saving history,
which stacks holiday and sacrifice and mourning
on one day for easy, convenient memory.
Oh, sweet world soaked, like bread,
in sweet milk for the terrible toothless God.
"Behind all this some great happiness is hiding."
No use to weep inside and to scream outside.
Behind all this perhaps some great happiness is hiding.
Memorial day.  Bitter salt is dressed up
as a little girl with flowers.
The streets are cordoned off with ropes,
for the marching together of the living and the dead.
Children with a grief not their own march slowly,
like stepping over broken glass.
The flautist's mouth will stay like that for many days.
A dead soldier swims above little heads
with the swimming movements of the dead,
with the ancient error the dead have
about the place of the living water.
A flag loses contact with reality and flies off.
A shopwindow is decorated with
dresses of beautiful women, in blue and white.
And everything in three languages:
Hebrew, Arabic, and Death.
A great and royal animal is dying
all through the night under the jasmine
tree with a constant stare at the world.
A man whose son died in the war walks in the street
like a woman with a dead embryo in her womb.
"Behind all this some great happiness is hiding."

He was the sort of man
who wouldn't hurt a fly.
Many flies are now alive
while he is not.
He was not my patron.
He preferred full granaries, I battle.
My roar meant slaughter.
Yet here we are together
in the same museum.
That's not what I see, though, the fitful
crowds of staring children
learning the lesson of multi-
cultural obliteration, sic transit
and so on.
I see the temple where I was born
or built, where I held power.
I see the desert beyond,
where the hot conical tombs, that look
from a distance, frankly, like dunces' hats,
hide my jokes: the dried-out flesh
and bones, the wooden boats
in which the dead sail endlessly
in no direction.
What did you expect from gods
with animal heads?
Though come to think of it
the ones made later, who were fully human
were not such good news either.
Favour me and give me riches,
destroy my enemies.
That seems to be the gist.
Oh yes: And save me from death.
In return we're given blood
and bread, flowers and prayer,
and lip service.
Maybe there's something in all of this
I missed. But if it's selfless
love you're looking for,
you've got the wrong goddess.
I just sit where I'm put, composed
of stone and wishful thinking:
that the deity who kills for pleasure
will also heal,
that in the midst of your nightmare,
the final one, a kind lion
will come with bandages in her mouth
and the soft body of a woman,
and lick you clean of fever,
and pick your soul up gently by the nape of the neck
and caress you into darkness and paradise.

I came to join a 'Peace Force,
To stop fighting, murder, war.
But now the war has started,
The 'Peace Force' is no more.
The fighting goes on - forever,
The murder has no because,
Just who wanted this stupid war?
I'd like life the way it was.
The way life was before the Bomb,
Before they slaughtered earth.
Before they killed the human race,
What was it really worth.
The generals in their office,
(Now floating round in space) !
Shake each others hands,
And put on a brave face.
Tiny peices of rock float by,
They used to be our world.
Now everything we loved is destroyed,
But the generals say we won.

It doesn’t matter what’s the cause,
What wrong they say we’re righting,
A curse for treaties, bonds and laws,
When we’re to do the fighting!
And since we lads are proud and true,
What else remains to do?
Lucasta, when to France your man
Returns his fourth time, hating war,
Yet laughs as calmly as he can
And flings an oath, but says no more,
That is not courage, that’s not fear—
Lucasta he’s a Fusilier,
And his pride sends him here.
Let statesmen bluster, bark and bray,
And so decide who started
This bloody war, and who’s to pay,
But he must be stout-hearted,
Must sit and stake with quiet breath,
Playing at cards with Death.
Don’t plume yourself he fights for you;
It is no courage, love, or hate,
But let us do the things we do;
It’s pride that makes the heart be great;
It is not anger, no, nor fear—
Lucasta he’s a Fusilier,
And his pride keeps him here.

Break off! Dance no more!
Danger is at the door.
Music is in arms.
To signal war's alarms.
Hark, a sudden trumpet calling
Over the hill!
Why are you calling, trumpet, calling?
What is your will?
Men, men, men !
Men who are ready to fight
For their country's life, and the right
Of a liberty-loving land to be
Free, free, free!
Free from a tyrant's chain,
Free from dishonor's stain,
Free to guard and maintain
All that her fathers fought for,
All that her sons have wrought for,
Resolute, brave, and free!
Call again, trumpet, call again,
Call up the men!
Do you hear the storm of cheers
Mingled with the women's tears
And the tramp, tramp, tramp of marching feet?
Do you hear the throbbing drum
As the hosts of battle come
Keeping time, time, time to its beat?
O Music give a song
To make their spirit strong
For the fury of the tempest they must meet.
The hoarse roar
Of the monster guns;
And the sharp bark
Of the lesser guns;
The whine of the shells,
The rifles' clatter
Where the bullets patter,
The rattle, rattle, rattle
Of the mitrailleuse in battle,
And the yells
Of the men who charge through hells
Where the poison gas descends,
And the bursting shrapnel rends
Limb from limb
In the dim
Chaos and clamor of the strife
Where no man thinks of his life
But only of fighting through,
Blindly fighting through, through!
'Tis done
At last!
The victory won,
The dissonance of warfare past!
O Music mourn the dead
Whose loyal blood was shed,
And sound the taps for every hero slain;
Then lead into the song
That made their spirit strong,
And tell the world they did not die in vain.
Thank God we can see, in the glory of morn,
The invincible flag that our fathers defended;
And our hearts can repeat what the heroes have sworn,
That war shall not end till the war-lust is ended.
Then the bloodthirsty sword shall no longer be lord
Of the nations oppressed by the conqueror's horde,
But the banners of freedom shall peacefully wave
O'er the world of the free and the lands of the brave.

War. And war some more.
War. And war some more.
No one knows,
What it's for,
War. And war some more.
The images seem
To rule the day,
War and Generals,
All the same,
All the answers,
Seem so lame,
All our reason,
Gone insane.
War. And war some more.
War. And war some more.
No one knows,
What it's for,
War. And war some more.

Reckless Doctors Prescribe Antibiotics Indiscriminately
Without even having a Blood Test, just on the Go
Do You know, Viral Infections have very less Medicines
Will subside in due course on its own automatically?
Antibiotics work only for Bacterial Infections
Not for Viral Infections, Virus escape Antibiotics easily
Many had bitter experience with Qualified Doctors
Prescribing Antibiotics indiscriminately
Antibiotics kill good Bacterias in Stomach
Results, GI upset, Diarrhea, Nausea,
Antibiotics have disastrous side effects
Impaired Liver, Damaged Kidneys are most important
Oflaxacin, Cifexime, Ampicillin, Penicillin are just a few
No accountability for Doctors, Indian Doctors specifically
Don't take Antibiotics unless double sure with blood tests
Indiscriminate usage may take a big toll in health, Life threatening
Ask your Doctors, if Antibiotics are must
Check  Internet for side effects
Better  believe  Internet, Not Doctors alone
Many Doctors  do Trial and Error Medication
Check  www.nlm.nih.gov, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed
www.umm.edu/ency/,  www.wrongdiagnosis.com etc for doubts
Nothing comes to light in India in Medical Field

Give me some pen and paper
and I will shower you with many a sweet verse,
give me a torrid tale,
and out of my poets purse-
I shall produce words of worth.
Allow me to sit in my little room,
and open my heart to strangers
But never
pluck my feathers of inspiration,
for I would never let you in again

If you want to retain your youth
don’t introduce him to your friends.
This a plain and simple truth
though your refusal may offend.
You cannot trust the best of friends
not to attempt to steal your guy.
Despite the fact that they pretend
that you can trust them completely.
Though you would trust them with your brass
and even with your credit card.
But men are in different class
in which you’ll find nothing is barred.
So if you want to keep your youth
believe my words they are the truth.

The son of two drops in the ocean
Was possessed of a singular notion
Oceanography was mastered
By this devilish dastard
Who's now 'fit to be tide' (land o goshen)

They say there is no Santa Claus
the bigger kids. Its just your dad
I don’t believe their lies of course
Although sometimes it makes me sad
I haven’t got a dad you see.
He died a long, long time ago
There’s just my mum my sis and me
That’s why I’m certain that I know.
There has to be a Santa Claus.
On Christmas morning there will be.
Some presents for each of us
in piles beneath the Christmas tree.
I only six but I know this.
That Santa works all through the night
making sure he does not miss.
A chance to bring a child delight.
One day I hope to catch the sight
of Santa Claus all dressed in red.
But mummy makes me go to bed
and she will watch for him instead.
She leaves mince pies and ginger wine.
Then she settles down to wait.
My sister goes to bed at nine.
Mum falls asleep and wakes too late.
He’s been and gone, so have the pies
While mother slept, kind Santa crept
into the house and ate the pies.
He left our presents while we slept.
At least that’s what my mother says.
If I should ask why she cries
On this the happiest of days.
Because I miss him she replies.
I’m not quite sure I understand
the reason for my mummy’s tears
Santa has gone back to Lapland
where has lived for years and years.
I think my older sister knows
A secret that she will not tell
She’s not allowed to suppose.
Because she sometimes cries as well.
But I’m a boy and boys don’t cry
But when they cry it makes me sad
Although I really don’t know why.
I never really knew my Dad.

Our fires burn with a fearless rage!
They burn at the humans in this cursed age
From friends to hunted the dragons soon became
We are now called 'beast' and by no other name
What paranoia could have spawned their hate?
Was it always to be, dragons doomed to fate?
One thing is for certain, it is not our will!
They will soon find dragons are not so easy to kill
Engulfed in our flames shall be the humans' reward
If ever they should attempt to put dragons to the sword

Where thoughts are about fear
Where stress becomes routine
The anger, lust, revenge
And vices tries to conquer
Human heart complains and asks
Stop stop and make things easy
It depends upon my health
The human heart, its performance
You makes it dangerous to sustain
You makes it feel disturbed
When you opt for foolish struggles
The heart says you are in danger
Hear, the wonderful organ
Highly sensitive to emotions
Keep the emotions less stressful
Where your speed must control
Otherwise heart will call it
To stop the journey itself.

A man there was, a gentle soul,
Of mild enquiring mind,
Who came into this neighbourhood
Its wonders for to find [ … ]
They told him who had put the lid
On Lydney; who the ale
Misspelt in Aylburton. And he
Delighted in the tale.
And still, like little Oliver,
He softly asked for more;
And with the utmost courtesy
Was answered as before.
Until one sleepy summer's eve
He came all unaware
Unto a place called Ruardean,
And asked ‘Who killed the bear?'
The man arose and punched him flat;
Another punched his head,
And when the rest had done with him
Our gentle friend was dead.
The moral of this simple tale
Is plain.  Dear friend, beware!
If you should visit Ruardean
Don't mention any bear.
If you should climb to Yorkley Slad
Pause not to question why
They put a pig upon the wall
To see the band go by.
And if your feet so far should stray
As Dymock, lest some hurt
Befall you, make no mention of
The man without a shirt.
Nine lives have cats, and you but one:
Risk not that gift of God!
It's better to be ignorant
Than dead beneath the sod.

Within the circumference of circumstance
We conjure up thoughts-once and again
In muted tones of caution
Of less IS more;
Wafting through this moment
Are jagged impressions left
Of a once pristine pure second
Where hand in hand we walked
A ribbon of a highway
Together-totally immersed
In effluent passion-simply oozing;
Upon a journey, so sure Golden;
Off our guard-ambushed
By the copper tendrils, laying in wait
Portents of a Paisley Sky
And a victim filled fate;

Without warning
as a whirlwind
swoops on an oak
Love shakes my heart

Cool earthenware pot
holding water as if it were
love that slopped & lapped
over its top
full to the brim
wearing with pride
the touch of your fingerprints
still visible
from its making
one lost windy night
the fierceness  of its blue glaze
and now it contains
summer
and this blessed coolness
of water
on this the hottest
day
green grass
becoming yellow
under the heat's gaze
and the angry voices
drifting out of an open
upstairs window
becoming lost amongst
thorns and their roses
bleeding into noon
our anger knocking over
all the things we made
seeing our earthenware pot
cool to the touch
& full to the lip with love
like water
fall through the air
becoming only shattered shards
an emptiness
that cannot be
contained no longer
for one moment in its falling
the water held
containerless
between Heaven & earth
before dashing itself
upon the floor
broken fragments
of water
(a voice screaming: 'It's
over...it's over! ')
broken fragments
of water
scattered here and there
splashes of lost love
love lost
lost love.

Red Muscadel – I know it will give a
headache tomorrow, but since my
left ear is sore, I don’t care anymore,
the taste is beautiful, sweet and
wonderful, how could I sleep
without alcohol?
All day long I tried to fix the ear,
but all in vain – at least I’ve changed
the situation; from somewhat bad to
completely intolerable – there goes my
plan to work tonight, with this pressure
and pain, my only gain Is a
perfectly watertight excuse
to refrain from working
tonight…
After determining that my excuse for not working
was infallible, I felt free of responsibility – and
therefore happily did the translation without any
pressure; with this painful left ear I could not go
to sleep and books seem quite boring right now –
the best are the Apocrypha, telling the story of
Jesus’ boyhood – he was a real cowboy; his clay
animals came alive and devoured the others..
The crocodile has been dethroned, no more reading
at top speed, I shall concentrate on translation -
no more gulping down knowledge, grasping only
half, this year I’ll slowly cover every subject;
translate at a snail’s pace to make sure I get
everything right – if worse came to the worst, I
could always die – so first let us try to harness
all powers on behalf -
…of Survival…

After the people went away,
Jesus chose another way,
With his disciples to cross
The lake and go across.
He climbed up a hill to stay,
And alone went there to pray.
By evening, for him to go back,
No boat was ready in the lake.
The waves tossed the boat.
The wind blew against it.
Early in the next morning,
On water, Jesus was walking
The disciples were afraid.
“It’s a ghost, ” they said.
“It’s I, Don’t be afraid, ”
Like this, Jesus replied.
Peter then spoke, “Lord,
Let me walk to your side,
On the water, if it’s you,
And what I see is true.”
“Come, ” this one word
Jesus blessed and said.
It was a surprise to Peter,
When he walked on water.
But the force of the wind,
Caused a fear in his mind,
That upset his balance
And he faced a crisis.
“Save me Lord, ” he cried.
To float on water he tried.
At once, Jesus pulled Peter
And saved him from water.
“Why did you doubt me?
Have you no faith on me? ”
Jesus smiled and said
His mistake, Peter realized.
The wind also died down
When they both stepped in
A boat that carried them
Without any more problem.
“Truly you’re Son of God, ”
Thus the disciples praised,
Thereafter they all realized,
Jesus was sent by the Lord.

Palms in hand
closed tightly fitting right into
the face.
steaming the tears falling
non stop.
planning a stop sign
a whole where i can stop
thinking im loosing
sickend almost as a dead weed
drooping towards the
hell of evil
as a deadly poisend rose.
the viens are
kiling stabbing within my
heart is eating away
as the love inside
has an attachted disease.
molds of the spreading water drops
steaming off my face.
with palms tightly in hand.

Your hands
caress the clay
it dances
to your fingertips
begs for shape
& form.
It seems as if
you create
the empty inside
first
the wet clay
waltzing with the wheel
curves that
can hold
nothing &
anything at all.
You smile.
Tell me the emptiness
is never empty.
It holds
what is to be.
It holds
the memories of wine
the thirst of water
the emptiness
is only
the something that
hasn’t happened
yet.
Years later
I still hold
those  curves in my hand
the emptiness of you
gone
still filling up
my mind.

When there is no water there is danger
When there is excess water there is danger,
Ranger of forest tells that trees die
Due to wiled fire that spreads,
It happens when there is no rain
And summer runs for long time and
When monsoon comes very late to rain,
Then excess rain brings flood in river,
Landslide is seen and devastation too,
Trees are uprooted in heavy rain and cyclone,
Climate change is a big threatening,
When there is no water life becomes desert,
When there is clean and pure water we drink,
Polluted and muddy water we cannot drink,
During heavy rain we see water and play
We see flowing water in many streets
But we feel still thirsty expressing grief!
In two thousand and one hundred drops of water
We do our daily rituals and offer prayer to God,
His greatest natural creation is water is nectar,
No other nectar can quench our thirst,
Water only quenches thirstof billions,
Water expels the grief of its scarcity and
We get unlimited happiness getting clean water.
Growing pollution at present in 2019 is in peak
What will happen to the water and air in 2100?
Perhaps we shall see a state of grief and joy,
Water scarcity will burst over its peak point,
If pollution grows at present rate
Then no river or stream water we can drink at all
Due to solar, nuclear, industrial and other radiations,
Although we will see the clean water near us
Still we shall fear to drink due to fear of cancer,
Water carrying radiation can easily cause cancer,
To avoid such danger by 2100 we should be careful,
At right now only we should promise for cleanliness,
Cleanliness with righteousness we need for purity,
In pure mind we should do meditation and link God,
Then we should add our vibrations into water sources,
Water should be charged with positive cosmic energy,
Then only we can get gradually pure water,
God helps us a lot to remove negative energy,
We have to protect greatest resource of nature,
Water is singing and dancing angel in God's garden,
Are you hearing the pure ripple sound nearer?
You feel, flowing water is singing holy song of God!

Save Water
Free Verse Poem
.We drink and use water,
.Without knowing what it does,
.What benefits it gives,
.Water is around but has decreased,
.Without knowing that the world is drying,
.Before the leaves get crooked up as life,
.We need to save water, to save our life,
.Water helps everything,
.As we need to help it too,
.We do not need water just to drink and use,
.We need it, to help it, so it can help us too.

Water Water Everywhere
Water water everywhere and not a drop to drink
That is of course until   this lovely ship does sink
There is nothing to compare to a sunrise     while at sea
Oh how I've missed those moments       special just to me
Sunrises on the ocean with        no one else around
Seems to show God's near us   without a single sound
Sunsets are special too,   dull moments they are not
Beautiful red  colors emitting hues   not too soon forgot
Night time on the ocean      brings many things anew
On moonless skies it seems so cold with just a hint of dew
Of course those starry nights are     quite a sight to see
The beauty of those twinklers was fashioned    just for me
I'll always miss the wonders the stars have    brought to me
And when I die I'd like my ashes spread far,   far out to sea
Jim 1999

The water
is flowing
with rage,
it splashes
and bubbles,
hurtles and
troubles,
anyone
who is
near.
The water
is flowing
downstream,
pulling
pebbles,
pinecones,
and people.
It's roaring
in the ears
of the raftors,
who are hollering
to be heard
over
the white
foaming
water.

But the weather is becoming more hospitable
in this part of the world

Once a favorite conversation piece,
now something more like a disease.
A weathervane sings, a wind chime clangs.
It’s December, only a slight silver breeze,
but already I’m imagining the tangled
metal of cars, birds falling from the trees.
My therapist says fear is normal,
that it’s simply a matter of degrees,
the brain has an internal mechanism,
she says, a switch that flicks on and off with ease.
I imagine a kind of silver machine
in my brain, humming like a hive of bees,
fear hopping from synapse to synapse
like some sort of electric, Post-modern flea.
Each day I swallow my grief like a pill,
ignore my therapist’s advice, my wife’s pleas.
I wait for the sky to fall, longing for the days
when wind was only wind, trees only trees.

'Tis Christmas weather, and a country house
Receives us: rooms are full: we can but get
An attic-crib. Such lovers will not fret
At that, it is half-said. The great carouse
Knocks hard upon the midnight's hollow door,
But when I knock at hers, I see the pit.
Why did I come here in that dullard fit?
I enter, and lie couched upon the floor.
Passing, I caught the coverlet's quick beat:--
Come, Shame, burn to my soul! and Pride, and Pain--
Foul demons that have tortured me, enchain!
Out in the freezing darkness the lambs bleat.
The small bird stiffens in the low starlight.
I know not how, but shuddering as I slept,
I dreamed a banished angel to me crept:
My feet were nourished on her breasts all night.

Easy it is to receive a bright sunny day,
To then say what events could have been prevented.
So easy it is when clouds of yesterday have passed,
To admit a limited point of view...
Could have been broadened if more time one had.
And easy it is to make repeated mistakes,
As long as one knows they will be forgiven.
But many are quick and too easy to offend,
When someone is honest with a truth spoken to them.
And deliberately mentioned regardless of the weather.

I love to look at the clouds above
They tell a story, don't you think?
Sometimes they are white and puffy
But can change within a blink
The wind picks up and blows in
Clouds so dark and bold
They almost take your breath away
Unlike the weather channel told
But nevertheless they are interesting
The rain may come pouring down
Get your umbrella ready in case
The weather may change in your town!

The weather warming up a bit it's getting warm today
And people for the weekend will be heading for the bay
To do a bit of fishing and relax by the sea
To surf or go skin diving or have a sea side tea.
It's nice to leave suburbia it's nice to get away
If only for the weekend for a brief holiday
To walk along the tide line salt water to your knees
or sit back from the high cliffs and feel the ocean breeze.
A weekend from suburbia to breathe the ocean air
To lay out on the sand dunes on beach reclining chair
A short break from pollution and the humid and noisy street
Down by the country coast line a different sort of heat.
November is upon us and Summer days are nigh
And weather getting warmer the weather glass is high
And not one sign of rain cloud in blue and sunny sky
And myna's song sounds sweeter as Spring goes laughing by.
The traffic will be heavy on the coastal highway
From 4 p m till after dark on evening of friday
As people leave suburbia mum, dad and family
And drive towards coastal country town for weekend by the sea.

There used to be winters before the weather became entertainment.
There was frost, rain, flooding and landslide one had to accept as norm,
unless it was of a disastrous dimension.1948 was so cold birds fell
from the sky and we had steal coal at the depot – a hole in the fence not
repaired before spring- the worker knew but looked away, this was a time
of social cohesion, we´re equally poor and recovering from a war
Snow in Ohio, and we see cars skidding on icy roads, what a distraction
from our sheltered life, nature actually exists and we better show respect
if not nature will turn against us and shake us into obeisance.

There is one thing we can’t avoid
And that, my friend, is weather
It is usually unpredictable
As the clouds began to gather
Or perhaps a puff of wind picks up
And those clouds will blow away
In summer the sun is warm and nice
And we hope that it will stay
But in the winter it’s so different
The clouds help us stay warm
They hover above protectively
Or is there a chance of a storm?
It is really very complicated
That’s why we have those who know
What it all means when suddenly
The winds begin to blow
Rain pours down and it floods
The wind brings a tornado
Hurricane’s can be devastating
So troubling, don’t you think so?
And the snow, oh let me tell you
It can cripple a city over night
It stops everything in its tracks
Blanketing what ever is in sight
The experts spend lots of time
With fancy equipment and such
But since we can’t change a thing
I don’t worry about it too much!

Crisp Winter, final season of the year,
Comes suddenly when awesome Autumn's past
The frost makes Winter mornings bright and clear,
But fosters Winter's biting icey blasts.
But Winter's winsomeness is also there,
The snow which hides the scars of furrowed ground,
The frost that sparkles on the hedgerows bare,
The snow that muffles harsh intrusive sound.
Ah! Winter, time of joy and peace and cheer,
Of carols chant and chimes of Christmas Bells,
The promise of 'The love that casts out fear',
The pleasure of sweet spicey Yuletide smells.
Remind us after Winter comes the Spring
When all things bright and beautiful will sing!
(John Knight - September 2009) .
Is Winter your favourite Season?  If it is please post a comment saying why. In the UK we have many many parties and presents and holidays celebrating Christmas and New Year, This is to compensate for many cold and drizzly days. Despite Global Warming we stll get some snow in the North and especially Scotland where we have popular Ski Resorts. Winter in the Northern USA and Canada and Scandinavia and Russia is awesome and a great opportunity for Winter Sports and Apre-ski! People whose Birthday is on Christmas Day (DECEMBER 25)   are doubly blessed because they are allowed a separate celebration on JUNE 25 in the following year.  I have used capital letters for the Seasons in this poem because I think they are worth it. It is no longer de rigeur in the UK.  John Knight.

The time has not come before
And this is new.
The light is opening for the day
An ingénue displaying her bosom
To man’s face-
I remember when
I was young in following her.
Her tassels feeling through the trees
And drinking roots,
She laughed even while
Alone;
Giggling,
She rode her bicycle across campus.
I staid up all night and prayed for her.
When tired, she slept
In the shade of a house-
Eyes half closed. I came to her,
She yawned and turned me away.
She said she loved me
Only when she was drunk,
And it was yet that time-
So long ago, yesterday....
Then early this morning she came to me
And offered me the quaff
Of lips.
Dripping nectar on the limbs,
She said, “Never before now, old man, ”
As they lowered me in the grave,
Her light budded
A valleyide of rubrum,
A wedding at my funeral.

I'm getting ready
For the garage sale tomorrow
My grandma passed away
A few weeks ago
She was a collector of things
You would never know.
I am thinking to sell
Her pair of wedding shoes
She wore one morning
Sixty years ago
Walking slowly
In a long tailed wedding gown,
Holding a bouquet of flowers in one hand
While her father held the other
Soon to be given away to her beau,
Walking beside her proud and smiling
In a wedding tuxedo.
Could she have wildly imagined then
That Thirty years later
Her unwed daughter
Would give me up for adoption
Shortly after I was born?
My mom, a poor mother
Could not face raising me up.
I look at the pair of shoes
They still look like new to me.
She saved them as a treasure
In the original shoe box, tucked
Under her wedding grown
In her old leather suitcase
Made in some small
Now a non-existent Texas' town.
The shoes are high heeled
Light brown, each with two leather straps
To go around the ankles
Some sort of a hybrid
Of dress shoes and sandals,
High fashion luxury of grandma's days.
I look at them again
And change my mind
I will not sell them
They are worth a fortune to me.
Sixty years ago
After I do, I do
The choir boy rang
the wedding bells
On the top of the steeple.
That moment, my grandma
Was wearing these shoes.

February 25th, 1851.
YOU are to be married, Mary;
This hour as I wakeful lie
In the dreamy dawn of the morning,
Your wedding hour draws nigh;
Miles off, you are rising, dressing,
Your bridemaidens gay among,
In the same old house we played in,--
You and I, when we were young.
Your bridemaids--they were our playmates:
Those known rooms, every wall,
Could speak of our childish frolics,
Loves, jealousies, great and small:
Do you mind how pansies changed we
And smiled at the word 'forget'?--
'T was a girl's romance: yet somehow
I have kept my pansy yet.
Do you mind our poems written
Together? our dreams of fame--
And of love--how we'd share all secrets
When that sweet mystery came?
It is no mystery now, Mary;
It was unveiled, year by year,
Till--this is your marriage morning;
And I rest quiet here.
I cannot call up your face, Mary,
The face of the bride to-day:
You have outgrown my knowledge,
The years have so slipped away.
I see but your girlish likeness,
Brown eyes and brown falling hair;--
God knows, I did love you dearly,
And was proud that you were fair.
Many speak my name, Mary,
While yours in home's silence lies:
The future I read in toil's guerdon,
You will read in your children's eyes:
The past--the same past with either--
Is to you a delightsome scene,
But I cannot trace it clearly
For the graves that rise between.
I am glad you are happy, Mary!
These tears, could you see them fall,
Would show, though you have forgotten,
I have remembered all.
And though my cup may be empty
While yours is all running o'er,
Heaven keep you its sweetness, Mary,
Brimming for evermore.

Oh! We have come across thirty six dark thorny streets hand-in-hand
And ultimately stranded here in the land of opportunity.
I shook the tall money tree in the back yard.
But only the decayed leaves fell leaving the ripen fruits on the tree top.
My beloved wife wants to make a love cake on this particular day.
And she search the money in her till.
She grumbled that I have stolen half of the collection for my aromatic cigars in vain.
There the mail came and were some greeting cards from Australia, Sri-Lanka & et cetera.
Our precious daughters and son-in-laws have sent some of their hard earned money.
We must be very grateful to our loved ones!
I whispered to my cock-a-hoop wife's ear; ' Darling leave the bourgeois love cake aside,
Buy a cheap bottle of wine and finish it to the bottom.
Then we could have a sound sleep on the couch
Dreaming of a better world to-morrow.
* The trouble is, old age is not interesting until one gets there.It's a foreign country with an unknown language to the young and even to the middle aged.
-May Sarton
As we are now

They waited sixteen long years
For the sounds of wedding bells
The wedding bells ring, dingdong, dingdong
The wedding bells sing, dingdong, dingdong
For all to hear strikingly clear
Hold your silence and wish them well
It is the sounds of wedding bells
This aged love birds have been waiting for
Once unofficial honeys
From this point declared official
In this matrimonial ceremony
I wish them well
Their braveness is my acknowledgement
Their enduring fight is my guiding light
Their victory will go down in history
Together they compliment and compliment
Each other like a perfect pair of fitting shoes
One way or another they already knew
Long before the sound of wedding bells
They would love each other till the very end
So listen to the sound of wedding bells
As they sing dingdong, dingdong
Perhaps for you it wouldn’t be long!

When Mardi Gras wooed Pantomime
they danced through all the streets,
the gods, whose Credo was the time
sent fireworks as treats.
As time does not stand still, you see
beauty unlocked the door
allowing spirits to be free
and scribes record the lore.
From New Orleans to Times bright squares
Verona, then to Rome
ignoring gawkers and their stares
so far away from home.
With sequined costumes everywhere
spark-lit harlequinade,
of apple shapes or stately pear
enlivened the charade.
As slapstick played with comedy
Toto digging out yellow road bricks,
and under the rainbow's canopy
there was Lion who juggled his tricks.
*****************************
Paparazzi were shuttled in
lenses clicked at the dropp of a pin.
There was always a crush
for celebrity lush,
cover page means you fight 'til you win.
Many dwarves did attend the event,
Mardi Gras, in a wagon or tent.
Pantomime at the door
for today and for more,
'twas Uranus who claimed love is meant.
Pink chrysanthemums tickling the paws
of Koalas (to flaunt local laws) ,
there was Tarzan who stripped,
a much shorter, tight-lipped
Popeye Sailor, who's singing the Bla's.
Theatre audiences, all were in awe
crowds were screaming, 'Mesdames, nous adore'
came Dionysos too
and the Socrates crew
Cleopatra not wearing a bra.
***********************************
As blue smoke pirouettes to the sky,
and the quivers from Burgundy moan,
there's a lady who flashes her thigh
and a tightrope surrounded by stone.
Gays in gowns then assemble, true Queens,
with their bitches performing as maids
Monkey saw, monkey do dancing scenes
of CanCan in their petticoat shades.
Seven dwarves with Snow White and fresh tears,
Pantomime on a horse of pure white,
dressed in blue are the three musketeers
bearing lanterns to light up the night.
Cinderella threw slippers, she knew,
there would come a young lad to her aid,
not a mermaid she needed her shoe
her two sisters preferred masquerade.
Twas a wedding to beat all events,
as white rabbits tossed roses around,
there was Romeo, near the big tent
little Blueboy asleep on the ground.
There was art, there was craft on the stage
and the witch had brought Haensel to town
and trapezes swung high in a cage,
Big Bad Wolf was dressed up in a gown.
On the banks of the river so blue
Papa bear from the Yellowstone Hills,
little Bambi andSkippy the 'roo,
they were smiling amidst all the frills.
**************************************
When Mardi Gras wooed Pantomime
and led her out the door,
she turned and said: ' I give this rhyme,
myself, and so much more;
I pledge my body and my soul
to you my Mardi Gras
and if you like I shall be whole,
discard my finest bra,
and, like a wedge of Maasdam Cheese
I slip right in between,
to have you kiss my cleavage (please)
outside the mens' latrine.'
**********
So now you've learnt the history
of how these lovers met,
and not a hint of misery
a perfect match was set.
When LOVE itself joins hand to hand
no end will ever come,
and all of us must understand
the music of our drum.

The flowering cherries
Flowing and pink,
Blossoms, like snow
Fall to the ground,
Never making a sound.
Like pink confetti,
Their petals are ready.
They must be The Wedding Trees.
I'll get married under one of these.
I, d like to get married
In satin and bows,
As petals fall on my clothes,
And scent touches my nose,
As I tingle at the toes.
So just hold my hand,
And we'll stroll through the land,
Tears roll down my face,
In this Heavenly place,
This is my Wedding day!

Thou God, whose high, eternal Love
Is the only blue sky of our life,
Clear all the Heaven that bends above
The life-road of this man and wife.
May these two lives be but one note
In the world's strange-sounding harmony,
Whose sacred music e'er shall float
Through every discord up to Thee.
As when from separate stars two beams
Unite to form one tender ray:
As when two sweet but shadowy dreams
Explain each other in the day:
So may these two dear hearts one light
Emit, and each interpret each.
Let an angel come and dwell to-night
In this dear double-heart, and teach!

i will love, cherish, and take care of you
all the days of my life.
for you have consented to be my wife.
i will honor and respect all your
beliefs and thoughts, for which you stood and fought.
you did not let anything distract or sway you
from your beliefs, which gave me a sense of relief.
because if anyone was able to sway you
in your younger years, we would not
find happiness and cheer.
you are strong, just like me
and you captured my heart and set me free.
and now that we are united as one
under the eyes of GOD.
i vow that we will never part.
and this will be the beginning
of our brand new start.

Crisply the bright snow whispered,
Crunching beneath our feet;
Behind us as we walked along the parkway,
Our shadows danced,
Fantastic shapes in vivid blue.
Across the lake the skaters
Flew to and fro,
With sharp turns weaving
A frail invisible net.
In ecstacy the earth
Drank the silver sunlight;
In ecstacy the skaters
Drank the wine of speed;
In ecstacy we laughed
Drinking the wine of love.
Had not the music of our joy
Sounded its highest note?
But no,
For suddenly, with lifted eyes you said,
"Oh look!"
There, on the black bough of a snow flecked maple,
Fearless and gay as our love,
A bluejay cocked his crest!
Oh who can tell the range of joy
Or set the bounds of beauty?

Around the house the flakes fly faster,
And all the berries now are gone
From holly and cotoneaster
Around the house. The flakes fly!--faster
Shutting indoors that crumb-outcaster
We used to see upon the lawn
Around the house. The flakes fly faster,
And all the berries now are gone!

In the glad springtime when leaves were green,
O merrily the throstle sings!
I sought, amid the tangled sheen,
Love whom mine eyes had never seen,
O the glad dove has golden wings!
Between the blossoms red and white,
O merrily the throstle sings!
My love first came into my sight,
O perfect vision of delight,
O the glad dove has golden wings!
The yellow apples glowed like fire,
O merrily the throstle sings!
O Love too great for lip or lyre,
Blown rose of love and of desire,
O the glad dove has golden wings!
But now with snow the tree is grey,
Ah, sadly now the throstle sings!
My love is dead: ah! well-a-day,
See at her silent feet I lay
A dove with broken wings!
Ah, Love! ah, Love! that thou wert slain -
Fond Dove, fond Dove return again!

Now the ice lays its smooth claws on the sill,
The sun looks from the hill
Helmed in his winter casket,
And sweeps his arctic sword across the sky.
The water at the mill
Sounds more hoarse and dull.
The miller's daughter walking by
With frozen fingers soldered to her basket
Seems to be knocking
Upon a hundred leagues of floor
With her light heels, and mocking
Percy and Douglas dead,
And Bruce on his burial bed,
Where he lies white as may
With wars and leprosy,
And all the kings before
This land was kingless,
And all the singers before
This land was songless,
This land that with its dead and living waits the Judgement Day.
But they, the powerless dead,
Listening can hear no more
Than a hard tapping on the floor
A little overhead
Of common heels that do not know
Whence they come or where they go
And are content
With their poor frozen life and shallow banishment.

Frosty-white and cold it lies
Underneath the fretful skies;
Snowflakes flutter where the red
Banners of the poppies spread,
And the drifts are wide and deep
Where the lilies fell asleep.
But the sunsets o'er it throw
Flame-like splendor, lucent glow,
And the moonshine makes it gleam
Like a wonderland of dream,
And the sharp winds all the day
Pipe and whistle shrilly gay.
Safe beneath the snowdrifts lie
Rainbow buds of by-and-by;
In the long, sweet days of spring
Music of bluebells shall ring,
And its faintly golden cup
Many a primrose will hold up.
Though the winds are keen and chill
Roses' hearts are beating still,
And the garden tranquilly
Dreams of happy hours to be­
In the summer days of blue
All its dreamings will come true.

The wintry west extends his blast,
And hail and rain does blaw;
Or the stormy north sends driving forth
The blinding sleet and snaw:
While, tumbling brown, the burn comes down,
And roars frae bank to brae;
And bird and beast in covert rest,
And pass the heartless day.
"The sweeping blast, the sky o'ercast,"
The joyless winter day
Let others fear, to me more dear
Than all the pride of May:
The tempest's howl, it soothes my soul,
My griefs it seems to join;
The leafless trees my fancy please,
Their fate resembles mine!
Thou Power Supreme, whose mighty scheme
These woes of mine fulfil,
Here firm I rest; they must be best,
Because they are Thy will!
Then all I want-O do Thou grant
This one request of mine!-
Since to enjoy Thou dost deny,
Assist me to resign.

All night the wind swept over the house
And through our dream
Swirling the snow up through the pines,
Ruffling the white, ice-capped clapboards,
Rattling the windows,
Rustling around and below our bed
So that we rode
Over wild water
In a white ship breasting the waves.
We rode through the night
On green, marbled
Water, and, half-waking, watched
The white, eroded peaks of icebergs
Sail past our windows;
Rode out the night in that north country,
And awoke, the house buried in snow,
Perched on a
Chill promontory, a
Giant's tooth
In the mouth of the cold valley,
Its white tongue looped frozen around us,
The trunks of tall birches
Revealing the rib cage of a whale
Stranded by a still stream;
And saw, through the motionless baleen of their branches,
As if through time,
Light that shone
On a landscape of ivory,
A harbor of bone.

When against earth a wooden heel
Clicks as loud as stone on steel,
When stone turns flour instead of flakes,
And frost bakes clay as fire bakes,
When the hard-bitten fields at last
Crack like iron flawed in the cast,
When the world is wicked and cross and old,
I long to be quit of the cruel cold.
Little birds like bubbles of glass
Fly to other Americas,
Birds as bright as sparkles of wine
Fly in the nite to the Argentine,
Birds of azure and flame-birds go
To the tropical Gulf of Mexico:
They chase the sun, they follow the heat,
It is sweet in their bones, O sweet, sweet, sweet!
It's not with them that I'd love to be,
But under the roots of the balsam tree.
Just as the spiniest chestnut-burr
Is lined within with the finest fur,
So the stoney-walled, snow-roofed house
Of every squirrel and mole and mouse
Is lined with thistledown, sea-gull's feather,
Velvet mullein-leaf, heaped together
With balsam and juniper, dry and curled,
Sweeter than anything else in the world.
O what a warm and darksome nest
Where the wildest things are hidden to rest!
It's there that I'd love to lie and sleep,
Soft, soft, soft, and deep, deep, deep!

There are strange and mysterious sounds
When the winds of winter blow,
The long nights are crystal clear and cold,
And the fields and meadows are covered with snow.
The stars are frosty against the sky,
And the wind's whistle is shrill,
As the snow blows against the house
And drifts against the hill.
Yet, I like to see during the winter
A white carpet on the ground,
To plod aimlessly in the deep snow,
where deer tracks abound.
I like to feel the stillness
Of a crisp winter's night,
Watching a full moon rise over the horizon,
Exposing a winter wonderland beautiful and bright.

What's keepng me
From writing better poetry
(Beyond not finding a word
That rhymes with orange)
I don't see myself as a poet
No one has granted me a license
I have however somehow
Learned how to wheedle words
Out of my head
Onto a blank page
I'll admit I have had to
Kick them around a bit
After they have landed
Some had to be kicked out
I was sad to see them go
It was like having to fire
Your cousin who just
Wasn't carring his weight
My additional problem is
That whenever I pick up a page
Of even my revised poetry
The words are still moving
Some are embarrased
Asking to be replaced
By better more appropriate ones
Some adamately think that
They should remain
Just as they are
Some are trying to jump
From here
To there
For clarity
So what's holding me back
From better words and arrangements
What's preventing a coup
What's keeping them
From breaking through the lines
And taking over
They know how much work
It was to put them there
They know I am reluctant
To call them back
Without having stronger replacemenets
That's all that's holding me back

All week she's cleaned
someone else's house,
stared down her own face
in the shine of copper--
bottomed pots, polished
wood, toilets she'd pull
the lid to--that look saying
Let's make a change, girl.
But Sunday mornings are hers--
church clothes starched
and hanging, a record spinning
on the console, the whole house
dancing. She raises the shades,
washes the rooms in light,
buckets of water, Octagon soap.
Cleanliness is next to godliness ...
Windows and doors flung wide,
curtains two-stepping
forward and back, neck bones
bumping in the pot, a choir
of clothes clapping on the line.
Nearer my God to Thee ...
She beats time on the rugs,
blows dust from the broom
like dandelion spores, each one
a wish for something better.

What is life without difficulty?
Is there such meaning as simplicity?
Problems only make us more stress.
And also give us white hairs.
Here are the school work.
Crash! I knelt on the floor!
Here comes the homework.
Bam! I fell on all fours!
' What are you doing? '
My mother boomed.
' School work and homework, Mom! '
I grumbled.
To be continued...

Work, work, work..
sitting effort,
on a chair
empty screen,
emotive stare
Work, work, work...
slunched shoulders,
side by side
warming ocean,
stolen pride,
Work, work, work...
hey man,
you man,
ant-field flys
pergatory,
promotion,
pitch-fork eyes.
Work, work, work...
college loving,
take me back,
drunk lace orgy,
primrose sack
Work, work, work...
day dream,
day stare,
simple soul.
Drop your complexity
and know,
your,
role.

SPIRIT whose work is done! spirit of dreadful hours!
Ere, departing, fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets;
Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, (yet onward ever unfaltering
pressing;)
Spirit of many a solemn day, and many a savage scene! Electric
spirit!
That with muttering voice, through the war now closed, like a
tireless phantom flitted,
Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat the
drum;
--Now, as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last,
reverberates round me;
As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles;
While the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders;  10
While I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders;
While those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them, appearing in the
distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,
Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro, to the right and left,
Evenly, lightly rising and falling, as the steps keep time;
--Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death
next day;
Touch my mouth, ere you depart--press my lips close!
Leave me your pulses of rage! bequeath them to me! fill me with
currents convulsive!
Let them scorch and blister out of my chants, when you are gone;
Let them identify you to the future, in these songs.

No thorns, limbs sashay longly, cheetah
walk toward
no prey, footloose, her dark blond hair
streaming, no intrusion. (Beer)     'Could I've
one? ' No
harm. 'Lotsa' people hang
out here.' No blame. (Smoke)
'Peace, ' she said,
in Chrystal clear Downeast, an aroma eluding words, &
a smile that lights a soggy
joint. 'Peace, '
she says, again,
long as she looks past the sniffing. '...I
don't think I've ever
voted... [T]here's a pebble in my shoe...' (and those
feet!) , nature jealously scraping along
her only
tan-less feature, limnable as last year's hangups.
She turns twenty-nine today,
loved me watch her walk away.

Work seems to be mandatory,
For people like me,
Slaving over books at school,
Just to get the grades,
We don’t have much money,
So after school I work,
Cleaning, babysitting, retail,
It’s tiring after awhile,
Homework and coursework,
Two more pains of teenage life,
It seems to me that I,
Work all night and work all day,
In the future for many years to come,
I know I’ll have to work,
Uni work and training,
I’ll need a part time job too,
But then I see, between it all,
I do get a rest and have fun,
I have great times, out with friends,
Addicted to CSI,
So now I work faster,
To get it over with,
Cus my philosophy is,
Work hard now, play harder later.

The Lord has work for all to do, prepared good works for me and you.
A work that is intended to Glorify, the One who on the cross had died.
Jesus’ work accomplished for all, man’s redemption from Adam’s fall.
Christ’s finished work for all of us, a work in which we place our trust.
And nothing can be added to, His work accomplished for me and you.
For salvation is a gift of Grace, secured when Jesus died in our place.
No righteous works on our part; it was all of Christ right from the start.
Christ’s finished work on that cross, alone is what saves sinners lost.
The work prepared for us you see, is to point others towards Eternity.
As God will use you in many ways, as you live out your earthly days.
God above can use most any skill, as it’s tempered by His loving will,
Pointing other men to Jesus Christ, as The Holy Spirit leads your life.
This work was prepared long before, anybody knew Christ was Lord.
An Eternal Plan by The Lord above, and centered on a cross of Love.
Where Christ Jesus paid the price, by offering Himself as a sacrifice.
For a body was prepared for Him, as the atonement for all of our sin.
Now for us the work to be done, is to lead all men to God’s Only Son.
What better work could there be, than in helping other people to see,
That The Lord Jesus died for us, and in Him we must place our trust,
So when all earthly labors cease, with Him we’ll have Eternal Peace.

Work work and hard work
There is no substitute of hard work
Only by hard work you can earn money
And money is not a thing to believe
Money fetches good food
Virility beautiful wife and charity
And all above have no eternity.

I wish I could take a quiet corner in the heart of my baby's very
own world.
I know it has stars that talk to him, and a sky that stoops
down to his face to amuse him with its silly clouds and rainbows.
Those who make believe to be dumb, and look as if they never
could move, come creeping to his window with their stories and with
trays crowded with bright toys.
I wish I could travel by the road that crosses baby's mind,
and out beyond all bounds;
Where messengers run errands for no cause between the kingdoms
of kings of no history;
Where Reason makes kites of her laws and flies them, the Truth
sets Fact free from its fetters.

I am a little world made cunningly
Of Elements, and an Angelike spright,
But black sinne hath betraid to endlesse night
My worlds both parts, and (oh) both parts must die.
You which beyond that heaven which was most high
Have found new sphears, and of new lands can write,
Powre new seas in mine eyes, that so I might
Drowne my world with my weeping earnestly,
Or wash it if it must be drown'd no more;
But oh it must be burnt! alas the fire
Of lust and envie have burnt it heretofore,
And made it fouler; Let their flames retire,
And burne me o Lord, with a fiery zeale
Of thee and thy house, which doth in eating heale.

When you look for peace
then the peace lies within you
When you search for peace
then it is not hard to find
When you want to keep peace alive
then you allow white doves to fly over you
When you make peace with others
then the whole world live in your heart
When you let peace be in the world
then you live in wonderful world
When you allow peace flow around the world
then your hateness will go and love will flow
When you open the door for peace
then peace welcome to your lives.
Let the peace prevail in our wonderful world

"The worlds in which we live are two
The world 'I am' and the world 'I do.'"
The worlds in which we live at heart are one,
The world "I am," the fruit of "I have done";
And underneath these worlds of flower and fruit,
The world "I love,"--the only living root.

O, lest the world should task you to recite
What merit lived in me that you should love
After my death, dear love, forget me quite;
For you in me can nothing worthy prove—
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie
To do more for me than mine own desert,
And hang more praise upon deceasèd I
Than niggard truth would willingly impart.
O, lest your true love may seem false in this,
That you for love speak well of me untrue,
My name be buried where my body is,
And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
And so should you, to love things nothing worth.

The goblet is sparkling with purpled-tinged wine,
Bright glistens the eye of each guest,
When into the hall comes the Minstrel divine,
To the good he now brings what is best;
For when from Elysium is absent the lyre,
No joy can the banquet of nectar inspire.
He is blessed by the gods, with an intellect clear,
That mirrors the world as it glides;
He has seen all that ever has taken place here,
And all that the future still hides.
He sat in the god's secret councils of old
And heard the command for each thing to unfold.
He opens in splendor, with gladness and mirth,
That life which was hid from our eyes;
Adorns as a temple the dwelling of earth,
That the Muse has bestowed as his prize,
No roof is so humble, no hut is so low,
But he with divinities bids it o'erflow.
And as the inventive descendant of Zeus,
On the unadorned round of the shield,
With knowledge divine could, reflected, produce
Earth, sea, and the star's shining field,--
So he, on the moments, as onward they roll,
The image can stamp of the infinite whole.
From the earliest age of the world he has come,
When nations rejoiced in their prime;
A wanderer glad, he has still found a home
With every race through all time.
Four ages of man in his lifetime have died,
And the place they once held by the fifth is supplied.
Saturnus first governed, with fatherly smile,
Each day then resembled the last;
Then flourished the shepherds, a race without guile
Their bliss by no care was o'ercast,
They loved,--and no other employment they had,
And earth gave her treasures with willingness glad.
Then labor came next, and the conflict began
With monsters and beasts famed in song;
And heroes upstarted, as rulers of man,
And the weak sought the aid of the strong.
And strife o'er the field of Scamander now reigned,
But beauty the god of the world still remained.
At length from the conflict bright victory sprang,
And gentleness blossomed from might;
In heavenly chorus the Muses then sang,
And figures divine saw the light;--
The age that acknowledged sweet phantasy's sway
Can never return, it has fleeted away.
The gods from their seats in the heavens were hurled,
And their pillars of glory o'erthrown;
And the Son of the Virgin appeared in the world
For the sins of mankind to atone.
The fugitive lusts of the sense were suppressed,
And man now first grappled with thought in his breast.
Each vain and voluptuous charm vanished now,
Wherein the young world took delight;
The monk and the nun made of penance a vow,
And the tourney was sought by the knight.
Though the aspect of life was now dreary and wild,
Yet love remained ever both lovely and mild.
An altar of holiness, free from all stain,
The Muses in silence upreared;
And all that was noble and worthy, again
In woman's chaste bosom appeared;
The bright flame of song was soon kindled anew
By the minstrel's soft lays, and his love pure and true.
And so, in a gentle and ne'er-changing band,
Let woman and minstrel unite;
They weave and they fashion, with hand joined to hand,
The girdle of beauty and right.
When love blends with music, in unison sweet,
The lustre of life's youthful days ne'er can fleet.

The world is a beautiful place
to be born into
if you don't mind happiness
not always being
so very much fun
if you don't mind a touch of hell
now and then
just when everything is fine
because even in heaven
they don't sing
all the time
The world is a beautiful place
to be born into
if you don't mind some people dying
all the time
or maybe only starving
some of the time
which isn't half bad
if it isn't you
Oh the world is a beautiful place
to be born into
if you don't much mind
a few dead minds
in the higher places
or a bomb or two
now and then
in your upturned faces
or such other improprieties
as our Name Brand society
is prey to
with its men of distinction
and its men of extinction
and its priests
and other patrolmen
and its various segregations
and congressional investigations
and other constipations
that our fool flesh
is heir to
Yes the world is the best place of all
for a lot of such things as
making the fun scene
and making the love scene
and making the sad scene
and singing low songs and having inspirations
and walking around
looking at everything
and smelling flowers
and goosing statues
and even thinking
and kissing people and
making babies and wearing pants
and waving hats and
dancing
and going swimming in rivers
on picnics
in the middle of the summer
and just generally
'living it up'
Yes
but then right in the middle of it
comes the smiling
mortician

This is my letter to the world,
That never wrote to me,-
The simple news that Nature told,
With tender majesty
Her message is committed
To hands I cannot see;
For love of her, sweet countrymen,
Judge tenderly of me!

When you were born in this world
Everyone laughed while you cried
Conduct NOT yourself in manner such
That they laugh when you are gone
Kabir's mind got cleansed like the holy Ganges water
Now everyone follows, saying Kabir Kabir
Guru the washer man, disciple is the cloth
The name of God liken to the soap
Wash the mind on foundation firm
To realize the glow of Truth
Alive one sees, alive one knows
Thus crave for salvation when full of life
Alive you did not cut the noose of binding actions
Hoping liberation with death!
Inexpressible is the story of Love
It cannot be revealed by words
Like the dumb eating sweet-meat
Only smiles, the sweetness he cannot tell
Worry is the bandit that eats into one's heart
What the doctor can do, what remedy to impart?
Says Kabir
Don't be so proud and vain
Looking at your high mansion
Death makes one lie on bare land
And grass will grow thereon
Says Kabir
Don't be so proud and vain
The clutches of Time are dark
Who knows where shall it kill
Whether at home or abroad
Says Kabir
By my doing nothing happens
What I don't does come to pass
If anything happens as if my doing
Then truly it is done by someone else
Like the pupil in the eyes
The Lord resides inside
Ignorant do not know this fact
They search Him outside
First the pangs of separation
Next grows the thirst for Love
Says Kabir then only hope
The union to materialize
