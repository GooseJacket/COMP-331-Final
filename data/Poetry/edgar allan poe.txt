THE RAVEN

[Illustration]


  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
  As of some one gently rapping—rapping at my chamber door.
  “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
                Only this and nothing more.”

  Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
  Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
  From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
                Nameless here for evermore.

  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
  Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
  “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
                This it is and nothing more.”

  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
  “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
  And so faintly you came tapping—tapping at my chamber door,
  That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door:—
                Darkness there and nothing more.

  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
  But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”
  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”
                Merely this and nothing more.

  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
  Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.
  “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;
  Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
  Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;—
                ’Tis the wind and nothing more.”

  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
  Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;
  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
                Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
  “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
                Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”

  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
  Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
                With such name as “Nevermore.”

  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
  Nothing further then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
  Till I scarcely more than muttered, “Other friends have flown before—
  On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”
                Then the bird said, “Nevermore.”

  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
  “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,
  Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
  Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore
                Of ‘Never—nevermore.’”

  But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
  Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
                Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”

[Illustration: PLUTONIAN SHORE]

  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;
  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
  On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,
  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,
                _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!

  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
  Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
  “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
  Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!”
                Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”

  “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
  Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
  On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
  Is there—_is_ there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”
                Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”

  “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
  By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
                Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”

  “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
  “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
  Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
                Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”

  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,
  And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
                Shall be lifted—nevermore!




THE BELLS

[Illustration: THE BELLS]

  I

          Hear the sledges with the bells—
                  Silver bells!
  What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
          How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
              In the icy air of night!
          While the stars, that oversprinkle
          All the heavens, seem to twinkle
              With a crystalline delight;
            Keeping time, time, time,
            In a sort of Runic rhyme,
  To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
        From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
                Bells, bells, bells—
    From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

  II

          Hear the mellow wedding bells,
                Golden bells!
  What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
          Through the balmy air of night
          How they ring out their delight!
            From the molten-golden notes,
                And all in tune,
            What a liquid ditty floats
    To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
                On the moon!

          Oh, from out the sounding cells,
  What a gush of euphony voluminously wells
                How it swells!
                How it dwells
            On the future! how it tells
            Of the rapture that impels
          To the swinging and the ringing
            Of the bells, bells, bells,
          Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
                Bells, bells, bells—
      To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!

  III

          Hear the loud alarum bells—
                Brazen bells!
  What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!
          In the startled ear of night
          How they scream out their affright!
            Too much horrified to speak,
            They can only shriek, shriek,
                Out of tune,
  In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
  In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,
            Leaping higher, higher, higher,
            With a desperate desire,
          And a resolute endeavour
          Now—now to sit or never,
        By the side of the pale-faced moon.
            Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
            What a tale their terror tells
                  Of Despair!
          How they clang, and crash, and roar!
          What a horror they outpour
      On the bosom of the palpitating air!
            Yet the ear it fully knows,
                By the twanging,
                And the clanging,
            How the danger ebbs and flows;
          Yet the ear distinctly tells,
                In the jangling,
                And the wrangling,
          How the danger sinks and swells,
  By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells—
                  Of the bells—
          Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
              Bells, bells, bells—
    In the clamour and the clangour of the bells!

[Illustration]

  IV

          Hear the tolling of the bells—
                  Iron bells!
  What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
          In the silence of the night,
          How we shiver with affright
      At the melancholy menace of their tone!
          For every sound that floats
          From the rust within their throats
                  Is a groan.
          And the people—ah, the people—
          They that dwell up in the steeple,
                  All alone,
          And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
            In that muffled monotone,
          Feel a glory in so rolling
            On the human heart a stone—
      They are neither man nor woman—
      They are neither brute nor human—
                  They are Ghouls:
        And their king it is who tolls;
        And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
                      Rolls
            A pæan from the bells!
            And his merry bosom swells
              With the pæan of the bells!
            And he dances, and he yells;
            Keeping time, time, time,
            In a sort of Runic rhyme,
              To the pæan of the bells—
                  Of the bells:
            Keeping time, time, time,
            In a sort of Runic rhyme,
              To the throbbing of the bells—
            Of the bells, bells, bells—
              To the sobbing of the bells;
            Keeping time, time, time,
              As he knells, knells, knells,
            In a happy Runic rhyme,
              To the rolling of the bells—
            Of the bells, bells, bells—
              To the tolling of the bells,
          Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
                Bells, bells, bells—
      To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.

ULALUME

[Illustration]


  The skies they were ashen and sober;
      The leaves they were crispèd and sere—
      The leaves they were withering and sere;
  It was night in the lonesome October
      Of my most immemorial year;
  It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,
      In the misty mid region of Weir—
  It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,
      In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

  Here once, through an alley Titanic,
      Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul—
      Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
  These were days when my heart was volcanic
      As the scoriac rivers that roll—
      As the lavas that restlessly roll
  Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
      In the ultimate climes of the pole—
  That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
      In the realms of the boreal pole.

  Our talk had been serious and sober,
      But our thoughts they were palsied and sere—
      Our memories were treacherous and sere—
  For we knew not the month was October,
      And we marked not the night of the year—
      (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)
  We noted not the dim lake of Auber—
      (Though once we had journeyed down here)—
  Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,
      Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

  And now, as the night was senescent
      And star-dials pointed to morn—
      As the sun-dials hinted of morn—
  At the end of our path a liquescent
      And nebulous lustre was born,
  Out of which a miraculous crescent
      Arose with a duplicate horn—
  Astarte’s bediamonded crescent
      Distinct with its duplicate horn.

[Illustration: ASTARTE]

  And I said—“She is warmer than Dian:
      She rolls through an ether of sighs—
      She revels in a region of sighs:
  She has seen that the tears are not dry on
      These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
  And has come past the stars of the Lion
      To point us the path to the skies—
      To the Lethean peace of the skies—
  Come up, in despite of the Lion,
      To shine on us with her bright eyes—
  Come up through the lair of the Lion,
      With love in her luminous eyes.”

  But Psyche, uplifting her finger,
      Said—“Sadly this star I mistrust—
      Her pallor I strangely mistrust:—
  Oh, hasten!—oh, let us not linger!
      Oh, fly!—let us fly!—for we must.”
  In terror she spoke, letting sink her
      Wings till they trailed in the dust—
  In agony sobbed, letting sink her
      Plumes till they trailed in the dust—
      Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

[Illustration]

  I replied—“This is nothing but dreaming:
      Let us on by this tremulous light!
      Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
  Its Sibyllic splendour is beaming
      With Hope and in Beauty to-night:—
      See!—it flickers up the sky through the night!
  Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
      And be sure it will lead us aright—
  We safely may trust to a gleaming
      That cannot but guide us aright,
      Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.”

  Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
      And tempted her out of her gloom—
      And conquered her scruples and gloom;
  And we passed to the end of a vista,
      But were stopped by the door of a tomb—
      By the door of a legended tomb;
  And I said—“What is written, sweet sister,
      On the door of this legended tomb?”
      She replied—“Ulalume—Ulalume—
      ’Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!”

  Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
      As the leaves that were crispèd and sere—
      As the leaves that were withering and sere;
  And I cried—“It was surely October
      On _this_ very night of last year
      That I journeyed—I journeyed down here—
      That I brought a dread burden down here!
      On this night of all nights in the year,
      Ah, what demon has tempted me here?
  Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber—
      This misty mid region of Weir—
  Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,—
      This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.”

BRIDAL BALLAD

[Illustration]


  The ring is on my hand,
    And the wreath is on my brow;
  Satins and jewels grand
  Are all at my command,
    And I am happy now.

  And my lord he loves me well;
    But, when first he breathed his vow,
  I felt my bosom swell—
  For the words rang as a knell,
  And the voice seemed _his_ who fell
  In the battle down the dell,
    And who is happy now.

  But he spoke to reassure me,
    And he kissed my pallid brow,
  While a reverie came o’er me,
  And to the churchyard bore me,
  And I sighed to him before me,
  Thinking him dead D’Elormie,
    “Oh, I am happy now!”

  And thus the words were spoken,
    And thus the plighted vow,
  And, though my faith be broken,
  And, though my heart be broken,
  Behold the golden token
    That _proves_ me happy now!

  Would to God I could awaken!
    For I dream I know not how,
  And my soul is sorely shaken
  Lest an evil step be taken,—
  Lest the dead who is forsaken
    May not be happy now.




LENORE

[Illustration]


  Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown for ever!
  Let the bell toll!—a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river.
  And, Guy de Vere, hast _thou_ no tear?—weep now or never more!
  See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!
  Come! let the burial rite be read—the funeral song be sung!—
  An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young—
  A dirge for her, the doubly dead in that she died so young.

  “Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,
  And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her— that she died!
  How _shall_ the ritual, then, be read?—the requiem how be sung
  By you—by yours, the evil eye,—by yours, the slanderous tongue
  That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?”

[Illustration: LENORE]

  _Peccavimus_; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song
  Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!
  The sweet Lenore hath “gone before,” with Hope, that flew beside,
  Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride—
  For her, the fair and _débonnaire_, that now so lowly lies,
  The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes—
  The life still there, upon her hair—the death upon her eyes.

  “Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,
  But waft the angel on her flight with a pæan of old days!
  Let _no_ bell toll!—lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
  Should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damnèd Earth.
  To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven—
  From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven—
  From grief and groan to a golden throne beside the King of Heaven.”




A VALENTINE


  For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,
    Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,
  Shall find her own sweet name, that nestling lies
    Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.
  Search narrowly the lines!—they hold a treasure
    Divine—a talisman—an amulet
  That must be worn _at heart_. Search well the measure—
    The words—the syllables! Do not forget
  The trivialest point, or you may lose your labour!
    And yet there is in this no Gordian knot
  Which one might not undo without a sabre,
    If one could merely comprehend the plot.
  Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
    Eyes scintillating soul, there lie _perdus_
  Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
    Of poets by poets—as the name is a poet’s, too.
  Its letters, although naturally lying
    Like the knight Pinto—Mendez Ferdinando—
  Still form a synonym for Truth—Cease trying!
    You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you _can_ do.

     [To find the name, read the first letter of the first line
     in connection with the second letter of the second line,
     the third letter of the third line, the fourth of the
     fourth, and so on to the end.]

AN ENIGMA

[Illustration]


  “Seldom we find,” says Solomon Don Dunce,
    “Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.
  Through all the flimsy things we see at once
    As easily as through a Naples bonnet—
    Trash of all trash!—how _can_ a lady don it?
  Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff—
  Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
    Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it.”
  And, veritably, Sol is right enough.
  The general tuckermanities are arrant
  Bubbles—ephemeral and _so_ transparent—
    But _this_ is, now—you may depend upon it—
  Stable, opaque, immortal—all by dint
  Of the dear names that lie concealed within ’t.

     [To find the name, read as in the preceding poem.]




TO HELEN

[Illustration]


  I saw thee once—once only—years ago:
  I must not say how many—but not many.
  It was a July midnight; and from out
  A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,
  Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,
  There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,
  With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,
  Upon the upturn’d faces of a thousand
  Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,
  Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe—
  Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses
  That gave out, in return for the love-light,
  Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death—
  Fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses
  That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted
  By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.
  Clad all in white, upon a violet bank
  I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon
  Fell on the upturn’d faces of the roses,
  And on thine own, upturn’d—alas, in sorrow!

  Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight—
  Was it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow),
  That bade me pause before that garden-gate,
  To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
  No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,
  Save only thee and me—(O Heaven!—O God!
  How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)—
  Save only thee and me. I paused—I looked—
  And in an instant all things disappeared.
  (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)
  The pearly lustre of the moon went out:
  The mossy banks and the meandering paths,
  The happy flowers and the repining trees,
  Were seen no more: the very roses’ odours
  Died in the arms of the adoring airs.
  All—all expired save thee—save less than thou:
  Save only the divine light in thine eyes—
  Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.
  I saw but them—they were the world to me.
  I saw but them—saw only them for hours—
  Saw only them until the moon went down.
  What wild heart-histories seemed to lie enwritten
  Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!
  How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!
  How silently serene a sea of pride!
  How daring an ambition! yet how deep—
  How fathomless a capacity for love!

  But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,
  Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;
  And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees
  Didst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained._
  They _would not_ go—they never yet have gone.
  Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,
  _They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since.
  They follow me—they lead me through the years.
  They are my ministers—yet I their slave.
  Their office is to illumine and enkindle—
  My duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light,
  And purified in their electric fire,
  And sanctified in their elysian fire.
  They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),
  And are far up in Heaven—the stars I kneel to
  In the sad, silent watches of my night;
  While even in the meridian glare of day
  I see them still—two sweetly scintillant
  Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!

ANNABEL LEE

[Illustration]


  It was many and many a year ago
      In a kingdom by the sea,
  That a maiden there lived whom you may know
      By the name of ANNABEL LEE;
  And this maiden she lived with no other thought
      Than to love and be loved by me.

  _I_ was a child and _she_ was a child,
      In this kingdom by the sea:
  But we loved with a love that was more than love—
      I and my ANNABEL LEE;
  With a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven
      Coveted her and me.

  And this was the reason that, long ago,
      In this kingdom by the sea,
  A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
      My beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
  So that her highborn kinsmen came
      And bore her away from me,
  To shut her up in a sepulchre
      In this kingdom by the sea.

  The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
      Went envying her and me—
  Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
      In this kingdom by the sea)
  That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
      Chilling and killing my ANNABEL LEE.

  But our love it was stronger by far than the love
      Of those who were older than we—
      Of many far wiser than we—
  And neither the angels in heaven above,
      Nor the demons down under the sea,
  Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
      Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE.

  For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
      Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
  And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes
      Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;
  And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
  Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
      In her sepulchre there by the sea—
      In her tomb by the side of the sea.




FOR ANNIE

[Illustration]


  Thank Heaven! the crisis—
    The danger is past,
  And the lingering illness
    Is over at last—
  And the fever called “Living”
    Is conquered at last.

  Sadly, I know,
    I am shorn of my strength,
  And no muscle I move
    As I lie at full length—
  But no matter!—I feel
    I am better at length.

  And I rest so composedly,
    Now in my bed,
  That any beholder
    Might fancy me dead—
  Might start at beholding me,
    Thinking me dead.

  The moaning and groaning,
    The sighing and sobbing,
  Are quieted now,
    With that horrible throbbing
  At heart:—ah, that horrible,
    Horrible throbbing!

  The sickness—the nausea—
    The pitiless pain—
  Have ceased, with the fever
    That maddened my brain—
  With the fever called “Living”
    That burned in my brain.

  And oh! of all tortures
    _That_ torture the worst
  Has abated—the terrible
    Torture of thirst
  For the naphthaline river
    Of Passion accurst:
  I have drank of a water
    That quenches all thirst:—

  Of a water that flows,
    With a lullaby sound,
  From a spring but a very few
    Feet under ground—
  From a cavern not very far
    Down under ground.

  And ah! let it never
    Be foolishly said
  That my room it is gloomy
    And narrow my bed—
  For man never slept
    In a different bed;
  And, to _sleep_, you must slumber
    In just such a bed.

  My tantalised spirit
    Here blandly reposes,
  Forgetting, or never
    Regretting its roses—
  Its old agitations
    Of myrtles and roses:

  For now, while so quietly
    Lying, it fancies
  A holier odour
    About it, of pansies—
  A rosemary odour,
    Commingled with pansies—
  With rue and the beautiful
    Puritan pansies.

  And so it lies happily,
    Bathing in many
  A dream of the truth
    And the beauty of Annie—
  Drowned in a bath
    Of the tresses of Annie.

  She tenderly kissed me,
    She fondly caressed,
  And then I fell gently
    To sleep on her breast—
  Deeply to sleep
    From the heaven of her breast.

  When the light was extinguished
    She covered me warm,
  And she prayed to the angels
    To keep me from harm—
  To the queen of the angels
    To shield me from harm.

  And I lie so composedly,
    Now in my bed,
  (Knowing her love)
    That you fancy me dead—
  And I rest so contentedly,
    Now in my bed,
  (With her love at my breast)
    That you fancy me dead—
  That you shudder to look at me,
    Thinking me dead.

  But my heart it is brighter
    Than all of the many
  Stars in the sky,
    For it sparkles with Annie—
  It glows with the light
    Of the love of my Annie—
  With the thought of the light
    Of the eyes of my Annie.

TO F—S S. O—D

[Illustration]


  Thou wouldst be loved?—then let thy heart
    From its present pathway part not;
  Being everything which now thou art,
    Be nothing which thou art not.
  So with the world thy gentle ways,
    Thy grace, thy more than beauty,
  Shall be an endless theme of praise,
    And love a simple duty.




TO —— ——


  Not long ago, the writer of these lines,
  In the mad pride of intellectuality,
  Maintained “the power of words”—denied that ever
  A thought arose within the human brain
  Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:
  And now, as if in mockery of that boast,
  Two words—two foreign soft dissyllables—
  Italian tones, made only to be murmured
  By angels dreaming in the moonlit “dew
  That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,”—
  Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
  Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,
  Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions
  Than even the seraph harper, Israfel,
  (Who has “the sweetest voice of all God’s creatures,”)
  Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.
  The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.
  With thy dear name as text, though bidden by thee,
  I cannot write—I cannot speak or think—
  Alas, I cannot feel; for ’tis not feeling,
  This standing motionless upon the golden
  Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,
  Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
  And thrilling as I see, upon the right,
  Upon the left, and all the way along,
  Amid empurpled vapours, far away
  To where the prospect terminates—_thee only!_

THE CITY IN THE SEA

[Illustration]


  Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
  In a strange city lying alone
  Far down within the dim West,
  Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
  Have gone to their eternal rest.
  There shrines and palaces and towers
  (Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)
  Resemble nothing that is ours.
  Around, by lifting winds forgot,
  Resignedly beneath the sky
  The melancholy waters lie.

  No rays from the holy Heaven come down
  On the long night-time of that town;
  But light from out the lurid sea
  Streams up the turrets silently—
  Gleams up the pinnacles far and free—
  Up domes—up spires—up kingly halls—
  Up fanes—up Babylon-like walls—
  Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
  Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers—
  Up many and many a marvellous shrine,
  Whose wreathèd friezes intertwine
  The viol, the violet, and the vine.

  Resignedly beneath the sky
  The melancholy waters lie.
  So blend the turrets and shadows there
  That all seem pendulous in air,
  While from a proud tower in the town
  Death looks gigantically down.

  There open fanes and gaping graves
  Yawn level with the luminous waves;
  But not the riches there that lie
  In each idol’s diamond eye—
  Not the gaily-jewelled dead
  Tempt the waters from their bed;
  For no ripples curl, alas!
  Along that wilderness of glass—
  No swellings tell that winds may be
  Upon some far-off happier sea—
  No heavings hint that winds have been
  On seas less hideously serene.

  But lo, a stir is in the air!
  The wave—there is a movement there!
  As if the towers had thrust aside,
  In slightly sinking, the dull tide—
  As if their tops had feebly given
  A void within the filmy Heaven.
  The waves have now a redder glow—
  The hours are breathing faint and low—
  And when, amid no earthly moans,
  Down, down that town shall settle hence,
  Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
  Shall do it reverence.

[Illustration]




THE CONQUEROR WORM


  Lo! ’tis a gala night
    Within the lonesome latter years!
  An angel throng, bewinged, bedight
    In veils, and drowned in tears,
  Sit in a theatre, to see
    A play of hopes and fears,
  While the orchestra breathes fitfully
    The music of the spheres.

  Mimes, in the form of God on high,
    Mutter and mumble low,
  And hither and thither fly—
    Mere puppets they, who come and go
  At bidding of vast formless things
    That shift the scenery to and fro,
  Flapping from out their Condor wings
    Invisible Woe!

[Illustration: WITH ITS PHANTOM CHASED FOR EVERMORE BY A CROWD THAT
SEIZE IT NOT]

  That motley drama—oh, be sure
  It shall not be forgot!
  With its Phantom chased for evermore,
  By a crowd that seize it not,
  Through a circle that ever returneth in
  To the self-same spot,
  And much of Madness, and more of Sin,
  And Horror the soul of the plot.

  But see, amid the mimic rout
  A crawling shape intrude!
  A blood-red thing that writhes from out
  The scenic solitude!
  It writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs
  The mimes become its food,
  And the angels sob at vermin fangs
  In human gore imbued.

  Out—out are the lights—out all!
  And, over each quivering form,
  The curtain, a funeral pall,
  Comes down with the rush of a storm,
  And the angels, all pallid and wan,
  Uprising, unveiling, affirm
  That the play is the tragedy, “Man,”
  And its hero the Conqueror Worm.

The SLEEPER

[Illustration]


  At midnight, in the month of June,
  I stand beneath the mystic moon.
  An opiate vapour, dewy, dim,
  Exhales from out her golden rim,
  And, softly dripping, drop by drop,
  Upon the quiet mountain top,
  Steals drowsily and musically
  Into the universal valley.
  The rosemary nods upon the grave;
  The lily lolls upon the wave;
  Wrapping the fog about its breast,
  The ruin moulders into rest;
  Looking like Lethe, see! the lake
  A conscious slumber seems to take,
  And would not, for the world, awake.
  All Beauty sleeps!—and lo! where lies
  (Her casement open to the skies)
  Irene, with her Destinies!

  Oh, lady bright! can it be right—
  This window open to the night?
  The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
  Laughingly through the lattice drop—
  The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
  Flit through thy chamber in and out,
  And wave the curtain canopy
  So fitfully—so fearfully—
  Above the closed and fringed lid
  ’Neath which thy slumb’ring soul lies hid,
  That, o’er the floor and down the wall,
  Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
  Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
  Why and what art thou dreaming here?
  Sure thou art come o’er far-off seas,
  A wonder to these garden trees!
  Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!
  Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
  And this all-solemn silentness!

[Illustration]

  The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
  Which is enduring, so be deep!
  Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
  This chamber changed for one more holy,
  This bed for one more melancholy,
  I pray to God that she may lie
  For ever with unopened eye,
  While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!

  My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
  As it is lasting, so be deep;
  Soft may the worms about her creep!
  Far in the forest, dim and old,
  For her may some tall vault unfold—
  Some vault that oft hath flung its black
  And wingèd panels fluttering back,
  Triumphant, o’er the crested palls,
  Of her grand family funerals—
  Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
  Against whose portal she hath thrown,
  In childhood many an idle stone—
  Some tomb from out whose sounding door
  She ne’er shall force an echo more,
  Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!
  It was the dead who groaned within.

THE COLISEUM

[Illustration]


  Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary
  Of lofty contemplation left to Time
  By buried centuries of pomp and power!
  At length—at length—after so many days
  Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,
  (Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,)
  I kneel, an altered and an humble man,
  Amid thy shadows, and so drink within
  My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!

  Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld!
  Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night!
  I feel ye now—I feel ye in your strength—
  O spells more sure than e’er Judæan king
  Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane!
  O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee
  Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!

  Here, where a hero fell, a column falls!
  Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
  A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!
  Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair
  Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!
  Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,
  Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,
  Lit by the wan light of the hornèd moon,
  The swift and silent lizard of the stones!

  But stay! these walls—these ivy-clad arcades—
  These mouldering plinths—these sad and blackened shafts—
  These vague entablatures—this crumbling frieze—
  These shattered cornices—this wreck—this ruin—
  These stones—alas! these grey stones—are they all—
  All of the famed, and the colossal left
  By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?

  “Not all”—the Echoes answer me—“not all!
  Prophetic sounds and loud, arise for ever
  From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,
  As melody from Memnon to the Sun.
  We rule the hearts of mightiest men—we rule
  With a despotic sway all giant minds.
  We are not impotent—we pallid stones.
  Not all our power is gone—not all our fame—
  Not all the magic of our high renown—
  Not all the wonder that encircles us—
  Not all the mysteries that in us lie—
  Not all the memories that hang upon
  And cling around about us as a garment,
  Clothing us in a robe of more than glory.”




DREAMLAND


  By a route obscure and lonely,
  Haunted by ill angels only,
  Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
  On a black throne reigns upright,
  I have reached these lands but newly
  From an ultimate dim Thule—
  From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime
      Out of SPACE—out of TIME.

[Illustration: WHERE AN EIDOLON NAMED NIGHT ON A BLACK THRONE REIGNS
UPRIGHT]

  Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
  And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods
  With forms that no man can discover
  For the dews that drip all over;
  Mountains toppling evermore
  Into seas without a shore;
  Seas that restlessly aspire,
  Surging, unto skies of fire;
  Lakes that endlessly outspread
  Their lone waters—lone and dead,
  Their still waters—still and chilly
  With the snows of the lolling lily.

  By the lakes that thus outspread
  Their lone waters, lone and dead,—
  Their sad waters, sad and chilly
  With the snows of the lolling lily,—
  By the mountains—near the river
  Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,—
  By the grey woods,—by the swamp
  Where the toad and the newt encamp,—
  By the dismal tarns and pools
      Where dwell the Ghouls,—
  By each spot the most unholy—
  In each nook most melancholy,—
  There the traveller meets aghast
  Sheeted Memories of the Past—
  Shrouded forms that start and sigh
  As they pass the wanderer by—
  White-robed forms of friends long given,
  In agony, to the Earth—and Heaven.

  For the heart whose woes are legion
  ’Tis a peaceful, soothing region—
  For the spirit that walks in shadow
  ’Tis—oh, ’tis an Eldorado!
  But the traveller, travelling through it,
  May not—dare not openly view it;
  Never its mysteries are exposed
  To the weak human eye unclosed;
  So wills its King, who hath forbid
  The uplifting of the fringèd lid;
  And thus the sad Soul that here passes
  Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

  By a route obscure and lonely,
  Haunted by ill angels only,
  Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
  On a black throne reigns upright,
  I have wandered home but newly
  From this ultimate dim Thule.




EULALIE

[Illustration]


              I dwelt alone
              In a world of moan,
          And my soul was a stagnant tide,
  Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride—
  Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.

              Ah, less—less bright
              The stars of the night
  Than the eyes of the radiant girl!
              And never a flake
              That the vapour can make
  With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,
  Can vie with the modest Eulalie’s most unregarded curl—
  Can compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie’s most humble and careless curl.

              Now Doubt—now Pain
              Come never again,
          For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,
              And all day long
              Shines, bright and strong,
          Astarte within the sky,
  While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye—
  While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.




TO MY MOTHER

[Illustration]


  Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,
    The angels, whispering to one another,
  Can find, among their burning terms of love,
    None so devotional as that of “Mother,”
  Therefore by that dear name I long have called you—
    You who are more than mother unto me,
  And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you,
    In setting my Virginia’s spirit free.
  My mother, my own mother, who died early,
    Was but the mother of myself; but you
  Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,
    And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
  By that infinity with which my wife
    Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.




ELDORADO


      Gaily bedight,
      A gallant knight,
  In sunshine and in shadow,
      Had journeyed long,
      Singing a song,
  In search of Eldorado.

      But he grew old—
      This knight so bold—
  And o’er his heart a shadow
      Fell as he found
      No spot of ground
  That looked like Eldorado.

      And, as his strength
      Failed him at length,
  He met a pilgrim shadow—
      “Shadow,” said he,
      “Where can it be—
  This land of Eldorado?”

      “Over the Mountains
      Of the Moon,
  Down the Valley of the Shadow,
      Ride, boldly ride,”
      The shade replied,
  “If you seek for Eldorado!”

[Illustration]

TO F——

[Illustration]


  BELOVED! amid the earnest woes
    That crowd around my earthly path—
  (Drear path, alas! where grows
  Not even one lonely rose)—
    My soul at least a solace hath
  In dreams of thee, and therein knows
  An Eden of bland repose.

  And thus thy memory is to me
    Like some enchanted far-off isle
 In some tumultuous sea—
 Some ocean throbbing far and free
   With storm—but where meanwhile
 Serenest skies continually
   Just o’er that one bright island smile.

[Illustration]




TO ONE IN PARADISE


  Thou wast that all to me, love,
    For which my soul did pine—
  A green isle in the sea, love,
    A fountain and a shrine,
  All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
    And all the flowers were mine.

  Ah, dream too bright to last!
    Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise
  But to be overcast!
    A voice from out the Future cries,
  “On! on!”—but o’er the Past
   (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
  Mute, motionless, aghast!

  For, alas! alas! with me
    The light of Life is o’er!
  “No more—no more—no more”—
  (Such language holds the solemn sea
    To the sands upon the shore)
  Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
    Or the stricken eagle soar!

  And all my days are trances,
    And all my nightly dreams
  Are where thy dark eye glances,
    And where thy footstep gleams—
  In what ethereal dances,
    By what eternal streams!

  Alas! for that accursèd time
    They bore thee o’er the billow,
  From love to titled age and crime,
    And an unholy pillow!—
  From me, and from our misty clime,
    Where weeps the silver willow!

[Illustration]




HYMN

[Illustration]


  At morn—at noon—at twilight dim—
  Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!
  In joy and woe—in good and ill—
  Mother of God, be with me still!
  When the Hours flew brightly by,
  And not a cloud obscured the sky,
  My soul, lest it should truant be,
  Thy grace did guide to thine and thee;
  Now, when storms of Fate o’ercast
  Darkly my Present and my Past,
  Let my Future radiant shine
  With sweet hopes of thee and thine!

[Illustration]




A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM

[Illustration]


  Take this kiss upon the brow!
  And, in parting from you now,
  Thus much let me avow—
  You are not wrong, who deem
  That my days have been a dream:
  Yet if hope has flown away
  In a night, or in a day,
  In a vision, or in none,
  Is it therefore the less _gone_?
  _All_ that we see or seem
  Is but a dream within a dream.

  I stand amid the roar
  Of a surf-tormented shore,
  And I hold within my hand
  Grains of the golden sand—
  How few! yet how they creep
  Through my fingers to the deep,
  While I weep—while I weep!
  O God! can I not grasp
  Them with a tighter clasp?
  O God! can I not save
  _One_ from the pitiless wave?
  Is _all_ that we see or seem
  But a dream within a dream?

TO ZANTE

[Illustration]


  Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
    Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take!
  How many memories of what radiant hours
    At sight of thee and thine at once awake!
  How many scenes of what departed bliss!
    How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!
  How many visions of a maiden that is
    No more—no more upon thy verdant slopes!
  _No more!_ alas, that magical sad sound
    Transforming all! Thy charms shall please _no more_—
  Thy memory _no more!_ Accursèd ground
    Henceforth I hold thy flower-enamelled shore,
  O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!
    “Isola d’oro! Fior di Levante!”

  In the greenest of our valleys
    By good angels tenanted,
  Once a fair and stately palace—
    Radiant palace—reared its head.
  In the monarch Thought’s dominion—
    It stood there!
  Never seraph spread a pinion
    Over fabric half so fair!

  Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
    On its roof did float and flow,
  (This—all this—was in the olden
    Time long ago,)
  And every gentle air that dallied,
    In that sweet day,
  Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
    A wingèd odour went away.

  Wanderers in that happy valley,
    Through two luminous windows, saw
  Spirits moving musically,
    To a lute’s well-tunèd law,
  Round about a throne where, sitting
    (Porphyrogene!)
  In state his glory well befitting,
    The ruler of the realm was seen.

  And all with pearl and ruby glowing
    Was the fair palace door,
  Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
    And sparkling evermore,
  A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty
    Was but to sing,
  In voices of surpassing beauty,
    The wit and wisdom of their king.

  But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
    Assailed the monarch’s high estate;
  (Ah, let us mourn!—for never morrow
    Shall dawn upon him desolate!)
  And round about his home the glory
    That blushed and bloomed,
  Is but a dim-remembered story
    Of the old time entombed.

  And travellers now within that valley,
    Through the red-litten windows see
  Vast forms that move fantastically
    To a discordant melody;
  While, like a ghastly rapid river,
    Through the pale door
  A hideous throng rush out for ever
    And laugh—but smile no more.

SILENCE

[Illustration]


  There are some qualities—some incorporate things,
    That have a double life, which thus is made
  A type of that twin entity which springs
    From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
  There is a two-fold _Silence_—sea and shore—
    Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
    Newly with grass o’ergrown; some solemn graces,
  Some human memories and tearful lore,
  Render him terrorless: his name’s “No More.”
  He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
    No power hath he of evil in himself;
  But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
    Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
  That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
  No foot of man), commend thyself to God!

ISRAFEL

[Illustration]

     And the angel Israfel, whose heart-strings are a lute, and
     who has the sweetest voice of all God’s creatures.—_Koran._


  In Heaven a spirit doth dwell
    “Whose heart-strings are a lute;”
  None sing so wildly well
  As the angel Israfel,
  And the giddy Stars (so legends tell),
  Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
    Of his voice, all mute.

  Tottering above
    In her highest noon,
    The enamoured Moon
  Blushes with love,
    While, to listen, the red levin
    (With the rapid Pleiads, even,
    Which were seven),
    Pauses in Heaven.

  And they say (the starry choir
    And the other listening things)
  That Israfeli’s fire
  Is owing to that lyre
    By which he sits and sings—
  The trembling living wire
    Of those unusual strings.

  But the skies that angel trod,
    Where deep thoughts are a duty—
  Where Love’s a grown-up God—
    Where the Houri glances are
  Imbued with all the beauty
    Which we worship in a star.

  Therefore, thou art not wrong,
    Israfeli, who despisest
  An unimpassioned song;
  To thee the laurels belong,
    Best bard, because the wisest!
  Merrily live and long!

  The ecstasies above
    With thy burning measures suit—
  Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
    With the fervour of thy lute—
    Well may the stars be mute!

  Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
    Is a world of sweets and sours;
    Our flowers are merely—flowers,
  And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
    Is the sunshine of ours.

  If I could dwell
  Where Israfel
    Hath dwelt, and he where I,
  He might not sing so wildly well
    A mortal melody,
  While a bolder note than this might swell
    From my lyre within the sky.

TO M. L. S——

[Illustration]


  Of all who hail thy presence as the morning—
  Of all to whom thine absence is the night—
  The blotting utterly from out high heaven
  The sacred sun—of all who, weeping, bless thee
  Hourly for hope—for life—ah, above all,
  For the resurrection of deep buried faith
  In truth, in virtue, in humanity—
  Of all who, on despair’s unhallowed bed
  Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen
  At thy soft-murmured words, “Let there be light!”
  At thy soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
  In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes—
  Of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude
  Nearest resembles worship,—oh, remember
  The truest, the most fervently devoted,
  And think that these weak lines are written by him—
  By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think
  His spirit is communing with an angel’s.




The VALLEY of UNREST

[Illustration]


  Once it smiled a silent dell
  Where the people did not dwell;
  They had gone unto the wars,
  Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
  Nightly, from their azure towers,
  To keep watch above the flowers,
  In the midst of which all day
  The red sunlight lazily lay.
  Now each visitor shall confess
  The sad valley’s restlessness.
  Nothing there is motionless—
  Nothing save the airs that brood
  Over the magic solitude.

  Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
  That palpitate like the chill seas
  Around the misty Hebrides!
  Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
  That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
  Unceasingly, from morn till even,
  Over the violets there that lie
  In myriad types of the human eye—
  Over the lilies there that wave
  And weep above a nameless grave!
  They wave:—from out their fragrant tops
  Eternal dews come down in drops.
  They weep:—from off their delicate stems
  Perennial tears descend in gems.

     NOTE (1845)

     Private reasons—some of which have reference to the sin
     of plagiarism, and others to the date of Tennyson’s first
     poems—have induced me, after some hesitation, to republish
     these, the crude compositions of my earliest boyhood. They
     are printed _verbatim_—without alteration from the original
     edition—the date of which is too remote to be judiciously
     acknowledged.—E. A. P.




TO HELEN

[Illustration]


  Helen, thy beauty is to me
    Like those Nicean barks of yore,
  That gently, o’er a perfumed sea,
    The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
    To his own native shore.

  On desperate seas long wont to roam,
    Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
  Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
    To the glory that was Greece,
  To the grandeur that was Rome.

  Lo! in yon brilliant window niche,
    How statue-like I see thee stand,
    The agate lamp within thy hand!
  Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
    Are Holy Land!




SONNET—TO SCIENCE

[Illustration]


  Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art!
    Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
  Why preyest thou thus upon the poet’s heart,
    Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?
  How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
    Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
  To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,
    Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?
  Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
    And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
  To seek a shelter in some happier star?
    Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,
  The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
    The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?




SPIRITS OF THE DEAD

[Illustration]


  Thy soul shall find itself alone
  ’Mid dark thoughts of the grey tomb-stone—
  Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
  Into thine hour of secrecy.
  Be silent in that solitude
    Which is not loneliness—for then
  The spirits of the dead who stood
    In life before thee are again
  In death around thee—and their will
  Shall overshadow thee: be still.
  The night—tho’ clear—shall frown—
  And the stars shall not look down
  From their high thrones in the Heaven,
  With light like Hope to mortals given—
  But their red orbs, without beam,
  To thy weariness shall seem
  As a burning and a fever
  Which would cling to thee for ever.
  Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish—
  Now are visions ne’er to vanish—
  From thy spirit shall they pass
  No more—like dew-drops from the grass.
  The breeze—the breath of God—is still—
  And the mist upon the hill
  Shadowy—shadowy—yet unbroken,
  Is a symbol and a token—
  How it hangs upon the trees,
  A mystery of mysteries!




EVENING STAR

[Illustration]


  ’Twas noontide of summer,
    And midtime of night,
  And stars, in their orbits,
    Shone pale, through the light
  Of the brighter, cold moon,
    ’Mid planets her slaves,
  Herself in the Heavens,
    Her beam on the waves.

    I gazed awhile
    On her cold smile,
  Too cold—too cold for me;
    There passed, as a shroud,
    A fleecy cloud,
  And I turned away to thee,
    Proud Evening Star,
    In thy glory afar
  And dearer thy beam shall be;
    For joy to my heart
    Is the proud part
  Thou bearest in Heaven at night,
    And more I admire
    Thy distant fire,
  Than that colder, lowly light.

FAIRY LAND

[Illustration]

  Dim vales—and shadowy floods—
  And cloudy-looking woods,
  Whose forms we can’t discover
  For the tears that drip all over!
  Huge moons there wax and wane—
  Again—again—again—
  Every moment of the night—
  For ever changing places—
  And they put out the star-light
  With the breath from their pale faces.
  About twelve by the moon-dial
  One more filmy than the rest
  (A kind which, upon trial,
  They have found to be the best)
  Comes down—still down—and down
  With its centre on the crown
  Of a mountain’s eminence,
  While its wide circumference
  In easy drapery falls
  Over hamlets, over halls,
  Wherever they may be—
  O’er the strange woods—o’er the sea—
  Over spirits on the wing—
  Over every drowsy thing—
  And buries them up quite
  In a labyrinth of light—
  And then, how deep!—O, deep!
  Is the passion of their sleep.
  In the morning they arise,
  And their moony covering
  Is soaring in the skies,
  With the tempests as they toss,
  Like——almost any thing—
  Or a yellow Albatross.
  They use that moon no more
  For the same end as before—
  Videlicet a tent—
  Which I think extravagant:
  Its atomies, however,
  Into a shower dissever,
  Of which those butterflies,
  Of Earth, who seek the skies,
  And so come down again
  (Never-contented things!)
  Have brought a specimen
  Upon their quivering wings.

THE LAKE—

TO ——

[Illustration]


  In spring of youth it was my lot
  To haunt of the wide world a spot
  The which I could not love the less—
  So lovely was the loneliness
  Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,
  And the tall pines that towered around.

  But when the Night had thrown her pall
  Upon that spot, as upon all,
  And the mystic wind went by
  Murmuring in melody—
  Then—ah, then, I would awake
  To the terror of the lone lake.

  Yet that terror was not fright,
  But a tremulous delight—
  A feeling not the jewelled mine
  Could teach or bribe me to define—
  Nor Love—although the Love were thine.

  Death was in that poisonous wave,
  And in its gulf a fitting grave
  For him who thence could solace bring
  To his lone imagining—
  Whose solitary soul could make
  An Eden of that dim lake.




A DREAM

[Illustration]


  In visions of the dark night
    I have dreamed of joy departed—
  But a waking dream of life and light
    Hath left me broken-hearted.

  Ah! what is not a dream by day
    To him whose eyes are cast
  On things around him with a ray
    Turned back upon the past?

  That holy dream—that holy dream,
    While all the world were chiding,
  Hath cheered me as a lovely beam,
    A lonely spirit guiding.

  What though that light, thro’ storm and night,
    So trembled from afar—
  What could there be more purely bright
    In Truth’s day-star?




A PÆAN

[Illustration]


  How shall the burial rite be read?
    The solemn song be sung?
  The requiem for the loveliest dead,
    That ever died so young?

  Her friends are gazing on her,
    And on her gaudy bier,
  And weep!—oh! to dishonour
    Dead beauty with a tear!

  They loved her for her wealth—
    And they hated her for her pride—
  But she grew in feeble health,
    And they _love_ her—that she died.

  They tell me (while they speak
    Of her “costly broider’d pall”)
  That my voice is growing weak—
    That I should not sing at all—

  Or that my tone should be
    Tuned to such solemn song
  So mournfully—so mournfully,
    That the dead may feel no wrong.

  But she is gone above,
    With young Hope at her side,
  And I am drunk with love
    Of the dead, who is my bride.—

  Of the dead—dead who lies
    All perfumed there,
  With the death upon her eyes,
    And the life upon her hair.

  Thus on the coffin loud and long
    I strike—the murmur sent
  Through the grey chambers to my song,
    Shall be the accompaniment.

  Thou diedst in thy life’s June—
    But thou didst not die too fair:
  Thou didst not die too soon,
    Nor with too calm an air.

  From more than friends on earth,
    Thy life and love are riven,
  To join the untainted mirth
    Of more than thrones in heaven.—

  Therefore, to thee this night
    I will no requiem raise,
  But waft thee on thy flight,
    With a Pæan of old days.




THE HAPPIEST DAY

[Illustration]


  The happiest day—the happiest hour
    My seared and blighted heart hath known,
  The highest hope of pride and power,
    I feel hath flown.

  Of power! said I? Yes! such I ween
    But they have vanished long, alas!
  The visions of my youth have been—
    But let them pass.

  And pride, what have I now with thee?
    Another brow may ev’n inherit
  The venom thou hast poured on me—
    Be still my spirit!

  The happiest day—the happiest hour
    Mine eyes shall see—have ever seen
  The brightest glance of pride and power
    I feel have been:

  But were that hope of pride and power
    Now offered with the pain
  Ev’n _then_ I felt—that brightest hour
    I would not live again:

  For on its wing was dark alloy
    And as it fluttered—fell
  An essence—powerful to destroy
    A soul that knew it well.

[Illustration]




ALONE


  From childhood’s hour I have not been
  As others were—I have not seen
  As others saw—I could not bring
  My passions from a common spring.
  From the same source I have not taken
  My sorrow—I could not awaken
  My heart to joy at the same tone—
  And all I loved, _I_ loved alone.
  Then—in my childhood—in the dawn
  Of a most stormy life—was drawn
  From every depth of good and ill
  The mystery which binds me still—
  From the torrent, or the fountain—
  From the red cliff of the mountain—
  From the sun that round me rolled
  In its autumn tint of gold—
  From the lightning in the sky
  As it passed me flying by—
  From the thunder and the storm—
  And the cloud that took the form
  (When the rest of Heaven was blue)
  Of a demon in my view.

STANZAS

[Illustration]

  _How often we forget all time, when lone
  Admiring Nature’s universal throne;
  Her woods—her wilds—her mountains—the intense
  Reply of Hers to Our intelligence!_
                                    BYRON.


  I

  In youth I have known one with whom the Earth
    In secret communing held—as he with it,
  In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth:
    Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit
  From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth
    A passionate light such for his spirit was fit—
  And yet that spirit knew not, in the hour
  Of its own fervour, what had o’er it power.

  II

  Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
    To a fever by the moonbeam that hangs o’er,
  But I will half believe that wild light fraught
    With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
  Hath ever told—or is it of a thought
    The unembodied essence, and no more
  That with a quickening spell doth o’er us pass
  As dew of the night-time o’er the summer grass?

  III

  Doth o’er us pass, when, as th’ expanding eye
    To the loved object—so the tear to the lid
  Will start, which lately slept in apathy?
    And yet it need not be—that object—hid
  From us in life, but common—which doth lie
    Each hour before us—but then only bid
  With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken,
  To awake us—’Tis a symbol and a token

  IV

  Of what in other worlds shall be—and given
    In beauty by our God, to those alone
  Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven,
    Drawn by their heart’s passion, and that tone,
  That high tone of the spirit, which hath striven
    Though not with Faith—with godliness—whose throne
  With desperate energy ’t hath beaten down;
  Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown.




TO ——.

[Illustration]


  The bowers whereat, in dreams, I see
    The wantonest singing birds,
  Are lips—and all thy melody
    Of lip-begotten words—

  Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrined
    Then desolately fall,
  O God! on my funereal mind
    Like starlight on a pall—

  Thy heart—_thy_ heart!—I wake and sigh,
    And sleep to dream till day
  Of the truth that gold can never buy—
    Of the baubles that it may.




TO THE RIVER

[Illustration]


  Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow
    Of crystal, wandering water,
  Thou art an emblem of the glow
        Of beauty—the unhidden heart—
        The playful maziness of art
    In old Alberto’s daughter;

  But when within thy wave she looks—
    Which glistens then, and trembles—
  Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
    Her worshipper resembles;
  For in his heart, as in thy stream,
    Her image deeply lies—
  His heart which trembles at the beam
    Of her soul-searching eyes.




TO ——


  I heed not that my earthly lot
    Hath little of Earth in it,
  That years of love have been forgot
    In the hatred of a minute:—
  I mourn not that the desolate
    Are happier, sweet, than I,
  But that _you_ sorrow for _my_ fate
    Who am a passer-by.




SONG

[Illustration]


  I saw thee on thy bridal day—
    When a burning blush came o’er thee,
  Though happiness around thee lay,
    The world all love before thee:

  And in thine eye a kindling light
    (Whatever it might be)
  Was all on Earth my aching sight
    Of loveliness could see.

  That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame—
    As such it well may pass—
  Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
    In the breast of him, alas!

  Who saw thee on that bridal day,
    When that deep blush _would_ come o’er thee,
  Though happiness around thee lay,
    The world all love before thee.

DREAMS

[Illustration]


  Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!
  My spirit not awakening, till the beam
  Of an Eternity should bring the morrow.
  Yes! though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,
  ’Twere better than the cold reality
  Of waking life, to him whose heart must be,
  And hath been still, upon the lovely earth,
  A chaos of deep passion, from his birth.
  But should it be—that dream eternally
  Continuing—as dreams have been to me
  In my young boyhood—should it thus be given,
  ’Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven.
  For I have revelled, when the sun was bright
  In the summer sky, in dreams of living light
  And loveliness,—have left my very heart
  In climes of mine imagining, apart
  From mine own home, with beings that have been
  Of mine own thought—what more could I have seen?
  ’Twas once—and only once—and the wild hour
  From my remembrance shall not pass—some power
  Or spell had bound me—’twas the chilly wind
  Came o’er me in the night, and left behind
  Its image on my spirit—or the moon
  Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
  Too coldly—or the stars—howe’er it was
  That dream was as that night-wind—let it pass.
  _I have been_ happy, though in a dream.
  I have been happy—and I love the theme:
  Dreams! in their vivid colouring of life
  As in that fleeting; shadowy, misty strife
  Of semblance with reality, which brings
  To the delirious eye more lovely things
  Of Paradise and Love—and all our own!—
  Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.




ROMANCE

[Illustration]


  Romance, who loves to nod and sing,
  With drowsy head and folded wing,
  Among the green leaves as they shake
  Far down within some shadowy lake,
  To me a painted paroquet
  Hath been—a most familiar bird—
  Taught me my alphabet to say—
  To lisp my very earliest word
  While in the wild wood I did lie,
  A child—with a most knowing eye.

  Of late, eternal condor years
  So shake the very Heaven on high
  With tumult as they thunder by,
  I have no time for idle cares
  Through gazing on the unquiet sky.
  And when an hour with calmer wings
  Its down upon my spirit flings—
  That little time with lyre and rhyme
  To while away—forbidden things!
  My heart would feel to be a crime
  Unless it trembled with the strings.

  Kind solace in a dying hour!
    Such, father, is not (now) my theme—
  I will not madly deem that power
      Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
      Unearthly pride hath revelled in—
    I have no time to dote or dream:
  You call it hope—that fire of fire!
  It is but agony of desire:
  If I _can_ hope—O God! I can—
    Its fount is holier—more divine—
  I would not call thee fool, old man,
    But such is not a gift of thine.

  Know thou the secret of a spirit
    Bowed from its wild pride into shame.
  O yearning heart! I did inherit
    Thy withering portion with the fame,
  The searing glory which hath shone
  Amid the jewels of my throne,
  Halo of Hell! and with a pain
  Not Hell shall make me fear again—
  O craving heart, for the lost flowers
  And sunshine of my summer hours!
  The undying voice of that dead time,
  With its interminable chime,
  Rings, in the spirit of a spell,
  Upon thy emptiness—a knell.

  I have not always been as now:
  The fevered diadem on my brow
    I claimed and won usurpingly—
  Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
    Rome to the Cæsar—this to me?
      The heritage of a kingly mind,
  And a proud spirit which hath striven
      Triumphantly with human kind.
  On mountain soil I first drew life:
    The mists of the Taglay have shed
    Nightly their dews upon my head,
  And, I believe, the wingèd strife
    And tumult of the headlong air
    Have nestled in my very hair.

  So late from Heaven—that dew—it fell
    (’Mid dreams of an unholy night)
  Upon me with the touch of Hell,
    While the red flashing of the light
  From clouds that hung, like banners, o’er,
    Appeared to my half-closing eye
    The pageantry of monarchy;
  And the deep trumpet-thunder’s roar
    Came hurriedly upon me, telling
      Of human battle, where my voice,
    My own voice, silly child!—was swelling
      (O! how my spirit would rejoice,
  And leap within me at the cry)
  The battle-cry of Victory!

  The rain came down upon my head
    Unsheltered—and the heavy wind
    Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.
  It was but man, I thought, who shed
  Laurels upon me: and the rush—
    The torrent of the chilly air
  Gurgled within my ear the crush
    Of empires—with the captive’s prayer—
  The hum of suitors—and the tone
  Of flattery round a sovereign’s throne.

  My passions, from that hapless hour,
    Usurped a tyranny which men
  Have deemed since I have reached to power,
      My innate nature—be it so:
    But, father, there lived one who, then,
  Then—in my boyhood—when their fire
      Burned with a still intenser glow
  (For passion must, with youth, expire)
    E’en _then_ who knew this iron heart
    In woman’s weakness had a part.

  I have no words—alas!—to tell
  The loveliness of loving well!
  Nor would I now attempt to trace
  The more than beauty of a face
  Whose lineaments, upon my mind,
  Are——shadows on th’ unstable wind:
  Thus I remember having dwelt
    Some page of early lore upon,
  With loitering eye, till I have felt
  The letters—with their meaning—melt
    To fantasies with none.

  O, she was worthy of all love!
    Love as in infancy was mine—
  ’Twas such as angel minds above
    Might envy; her young heart the shrine
  On which my every hope and thought
    Were incense—then a goodly gift,
      For they were childish and upright—
  Pure as her young example taught:
    Why did I leave it, and, adrift,
      Trust to the fire within, for light?

  We grew in age and love together—
    Roaming the forest and the wild;
  My breast her shield in wintry weather—
    And, when the friendly sunshine smiled
  And she would mark the opening skies,
  _I_ saw no Heaven but in her eyes.
  Young Love’s first lesson is the heart:
    For ’mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
  When, from our little cares apart,
   And laughing at her girlish wiles,
  I’d throw me on her throbbing breast,
    And pour my spirit out in tears—
  There was no need to speak the rest—
    No need to quiet any fears
  Of her—who asked no reason why,
  But turned on me her quiet eye!

  Yet _more_ than worthy of the love
  My spirit struggled with, and strove,
  When on the mountain peak alone
  Ambition lent it a new tone—
  I had no being but in thee:
    The world, and all it did contain
  In the earth—the air—the sea—
    Its joy—its little lot of pain
  That was new pleasure—the ideal,
    Dim vanities of dreams by night—
  And dimmer nothings which were real—
    (Shadows, and a more shadowy light!)
  Parted upon their misty wings,
      And so confusedly became
      Thine image and—a name—a name!
  Two separate yet most intimate things.

[Illustration]

  I was ambitious—have you known
      The passion, father? You have not:
  A cottager, I marked a throne
  Of half the world as all my own,
      And murmured at such lowly lot;
  But, just like any other dream,
      Upon the vapour of the dew
  My own had past, did not the beam
      Of beauty which did while it thro’
  The minute—the hour—the day—oppress
  My mind with double loveliness.

  We walked together on the crown
  Of a high mountain which looked down
  Afar from its proud natural towers
    Of rock and forest, on the hills—
  The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers
    And shouting with a thousand rills.

  I spoke to her of power and pride,
    But mystically—in such guise
  That she might deem it nought beside
    The moment’s converse; in her eyes
  I read, perhaps too carelessly,
    A mingled feeling with my own—
  The flush on her bright cheek, to me
    Seemed to become a queenly throne
  Too well that I should let it be
    Light in the wilderness alone.

  I wrapped myself in grandeur then,
    And donned a visionary crown—
      Yet it was not that Fantasy
      Had thrown her mantle over me;
  But that, among the rabble—men,
    Lion ambition is chained down
  And crouches to a keeper’s hand:
  Not so in deserts where the grand,
  The wild, the terrible, conspire
  With their own breath to fan his fire.

  Look round thee now on Samarcand!—
    Is she not queen of Earth? her pride
  Above all cities? in her hand
    Their destinies? in all beside
  Of glory which the world hath known
  Stands she not nobly and alone?
  Falling—her veriest stepping-stone
  Shall form the pedestal of a throne—
  And who her sovereign? Timour—he
    Whom the astonished people saw
  Striding o’er empires haughtily
    A diademed outlaw!

  O, human love! thou spirit given,
  On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!
  Which fall’st into the soul like rain
  Upon the Siroc-withered plain,
  And, failing in thy power to bless,
  But leav’st the heart a wilderness!
  Idea! which bindest life around
  With music of so strange a sound
  And beauty of so wild a birth—
  Farewell! for I have won the Earth.

  When Hope, the eagle that towered, could see
    No cliff beyond him in the sky,
  His pinions were bent droopingly—
    And homeward turned his softened eye.
  ’Twas sunset: when the sun will part
  There comes a sullenness of heart
  To him who still would look upon
  The glory of the summer sun.
  That soul will hate the evening mist
  So often lovely, and will list
  To the sound of the coming darkness (known
  To those whose spirits hearken) as one
  Who, in a dream of night, _would_ fly,
  But _cannot_, from a danger nigh.

  What tho’ the moon—the white moon
  Shed all the splendour of her noon?
  Her smile is chilly—and her beam,
  In that time of dreariness, will seem
  (So like you gather in your breath)
  A portrait taken after death.
  And boyhood is a summer sun
  Whose waning is the dreariest one—
  For all we live to know is known,
  And all we seek to keep hath flown.
  Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall
  With the noon-day beauty—which is all.

  I reached my home—my home no more—
    For all had flown who made it so.
  I passed from out its mossy door,
    And, tho’ my tread was soft and low,
  A voice came from the threshold stone
  Of one whom I had earlier known—
    O, I defy thee, Hell, to show
    On beds of fire that burn below,
    An humbler heart—a deeper woe.

  Father, I firmly do believe—
    I _know_—for Death who comes for me
      From regions of the blest afar,
  Where there is nothing to deceive,
      Hath left his iron gate ajar,
    And rays of truth you cannot see
    Are flashing thro’ Eternity——
  I do believe that Eblis hath
  A snare in every human path;
  Else how, when in the holy grove
  I wandered of the idol, Love,—
  Who daily scents his snowy wings
  With incense of burnt offerings
  From the most unpolluted things,
  Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
  Above with trellised rays from Heaven
  No mote may shun—no tiniest fly—
  The lightning of his eagle eye—
  How was it that Ambition crept,
    Unseen, amid the revels there,
  Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt
    In the tangles of Love’s very hair?

AL AARAAF. PART I.

[Illustration]

  O! nothing earthly save the ray
  (Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty’s eye,
  As in those gardens where the day
  Springs from the gems of Circassy—
  O! nothing earthly save the thrill
  Of melody in woodland rill—
  Or (music of the passion-hearted)
  Joy’s voice so peacefully departed
  That like the murmur in the shell,
  Its echo dwelleth and will dwell—
  O! nothing of the dross of ours—
  Yet all the beauty—all the flowers
  That list our Love, and deck our bowers—
  Adorn yon world afar, afar
  The wandering star.

    ’Twas a sweet time for Nesace—for there
  Her world lay lolling on the golden air,
  Near four bright suns—a temporary rest—
  An oasis in desert of the blest.
  Away—away—’mid seas of rays that roll
  Empyrean splendour o’er th’ unchained soul—
  The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)
  Can struggle to its destined eminence—
  To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,
  And late to ours, the favoured one of God—
  But, now, the ruler of an anchored realm,
  She throws aside the sceptre—leaves the helm,
  And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,
  Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.

    Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,
  Whence sprang the “Idea of Beauty” into birth,
  (Falling in wreaths thro’ many a startled star,
  Like woman’s hair ’mid pearls, until, afar,
  It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt,)
  She looked into Infinity—and knelt.
  Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled—
  Fit emblems of the model of her world—
  Seen but in beauty—not impeding sight—
  Of other beauty glittering thro’ the light—
  A wreath that twined each starry form around,
  And all the opal’d air in colour bound.

    All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
  Of flowers: of lilies such as reared the head
  On the fair Capo Deucato, and sprang
  So eagerly around about to hang
  Upon the flying footsteps of—deep pride—
  Of her who loved a mortal—and so died.
  The Sephalica, budding with young bees,
  Upreared its purple stem around her knees:
  And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnamed—
  Inmate of highest stars, where erst it shamed
  All other loveliness: its honied dew
  (The fabled nectar that the heathen knew)
  Deliriously sweet, was dropped from Heaven,
  And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
  In Trebizond—and on a sunny flower
  So like its own above that, to this hour,
  It still remaineth, torturing the bee
  With madness, and unwonted reverie:
  In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf
  And blossom of the fairy plant, in grief
  Disconsolate linger—grief that hangs her head,
  Repenting follies that full long have fled,
  Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,
  Like guilty beauty, chastened, and more fair:
  Nyctanthes, too, as sacred as the light
  She fears to perfume, perfuming the night:
  And Clytia pondering between many a sun,
  While pettish tears adown her petals run:
  And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth—
  And died, ere scarce exalted into birth,
  Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
  Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king:
  And Valisnerian lotus thither flown
  From struggling with the waters of the Rhone:
  And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante!
  Isola d’oro!—Fior di Levante!
  And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever
  With Indian Cupid down the holy river—
  Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given
  To bear the Goddess’ song, in odours, up to Heaven:

          “Spirit! that dwellest where,
            In the deep sky,
          The terrible and fair,
            In beauty vie!
          Beyond the line of blue—
            The boundary of the star
          Which turneth at the view
            Of thy barrier and thy bar—
          Of the barrier overgone
            By the comets who were cast
          From their pride, and from their throne
            To be drudges till the last—
          To be carriers of fire
            (The red fire of their heart)
          With speed that may not tire
            And with pain that shall not part—
          Who livest—_that_ we know—
            In Eternity—we feel—
          But the shadow of whose brow
            What spirit shall reveal?
          Tho’ the beings whom thy Nesace,
            Thy messenger hath known
          Have dreamed for thy Infinity
            A model of their own—
          Thy will is done, O God!
            The star hath ridden high
          Thro’ many a tempest, but she rode
            Beneath thy burning eye;
          And here, in thought, to thee—
            In thought that can alone
          Ascend thy empire and so be
            A partner of thy throne—
          By wingèd Fantasy,
            My embassy is given,
          Till secrecy shall knowledge be
            In the environs of Heaven.”

  She ceased—and buried then her burning cheek
  Abashed, amid the lilies there, to seek
  A shelter from the fervour of His eye;
  For the stars trembled at the Deity.
  She stirred not—breathed not—for a voice was there
  How solemnly pervading the calm air!
  A sound of silence on the startled ear,
  Which dreamy poets name “the music of the sphere.”
  Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call
  “Silence”—which is the merest word of all.
  All Nature speaks, and ev’n ideal things
  Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings—
  But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high
  The eternal voice of God is passing by,
  And the red winds are withering in the sky!

[Illustration]

    “What tho’ in worlds which sightless cycles run,
  Linked to a little system, and one sun—
  Where all my love is folly, and the crowd
  Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,
  The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath—
  (Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?)
  What tho’ in worlds which own a single sun
  The sands of Time grow dimmer as they run,
  Yet thine is my resplendency, so given
  To bear my secrets thro’ the upper Heaven.
  Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,
  With all thy train, athwart the moony sky—
  Apart—like fire-flies in Sicilian night,
  And wing to other worlds another light!
  Divulge the secrets of thy embassy
  To the proud orbs that twinkle—and so be
  To every heart a barrier and a ban
  Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!”

    Up rose the maiden in the yellow night,
  The single-moonèd eve!—on Earth we plight
  Our faith to one love, and one moon adore:
  The birth-place of young Beauty had no more.
  As sprang that yellow star from downy hours,
  Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,
  And bent o’er sheeny mountain and dim plain
  Her way—but left not yet her Therasæan reign.

PART II.

[Illustration]

  High on a mountain of enamelled head—
  Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
  Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,
  Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees
  With many a muttered “hope to be forgiven”
  What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven—
  Of rosy head that, towering far away
  Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray
  Of sunken suns at eve—at noon of night,
  While the moon danced with the fair stranger light—
  Upreared upon such height arose a pile
  Of gorgeous columns on th’ unburthened air,
  Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile
  Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,
  And nursled the young mountain in its lair.
  Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall
  Thro’ the ebon air, besilvering the pall
  Of their own dissolution, while they die—
  Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.
  A dome, by linkèd light from Heaven let down,
  Sat gently on these columns as a crown—
  A window of one circular diamond, there,
  Looked out above into the purple air,
  And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
  And hallowed all the beauty twice again,
  Save when, between th’ Empyrean and that ring,
  Some eager spirit flapped his dusky wing.
  But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen
  The dimness of this world: that greyish green
  That Nature loves the best for Beauty’s grave
  Lurked in each cornice, round each architrave—
  And every sculptured cherub thereabout
  That from his marble dwelling peerèd out,
  Seemed earthly in the shadow of his niche—
  Achaian statues in a world so rich?
  Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis—
  From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss
  Of beautiful Gomorrah! Oh, the wave
  Is now upon thee—but too late to save!

    Sound loves to revel in a summer night:
  Witness the murmur of the grey twilight
  That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco,
  Of many a wild star-gazer long ago—
  That stealeth ever on the ear of him
  Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,
  And sees the darkness coming as a cloud—
  Is not its form—its voice—most palpable and loud?

    But what is this?—it cometh—and it brings
  A music with it—’tis the rush of wings—
  A pause—and then a sweeping, falling strain,
  And Nesace is in her halls again.
  From the wild energy of wanton haste
    Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;
  The zone that clung around her gentle waist
    Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.
  Within the centre of that hall to breathe
  She paused and panted, Zanthe! all beneath,
  The fairy light that kissed her golden hair
  And longed to rest, yet could but sparkle there!

    Young flowers were whispering in melody
  To happy flowers that night—and tree to tree;
  Fountains were gushing music as they fell
  In many a star-lit grove, or moon-light dell;
  Yet silence came upon material things—
  Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings—
  And sound alone, that from the spirit sprang,
  Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:

        “Neath blue-bell or streamer—
          Or tufted wild spray
        That keeps, from the dreamer,
          The moonbeam away—
        Bright beings! that ponder,
          With half-closing eyes,
        On the stars which your wonder
          Hath drawn from the skies,
        Till they glance thro’ the shade, and
          Come down to your brow
        Like—eyes of the maiden
          Who calls on you now—
        Arise! from your dreaming
          In violet bowers,
        To duty beseeming
          These star-litten hours—
        And shake from your tresses
          Encumbered with dew
        The breath of those kisses
          That cumber them too—
        (O! how, without you, Love!
          Could angels be blest?)
        Those kisses of true love
          That lulled ye to rest!
        Up! shake from your wing
        Each hindering thing:
        The dew of the night—
        It would weigh down your flight;
        And true love caresses—
          O! leave them apart!
        They are light on the tresses,
          But lead on the heart.

        “Ligeia! Ligeia!
          My beautiful one!
        Whose harshest idea
          Will to melody run,
        O! is it thy will
          On the breezes to toss?
        Or, capriciously still,
          Like the lone Albatross,
        Incumbent on night
          (As she on the air)
        To keep watch with delight
          On the harmony there?

        “Ligeia! wherever
          Thy image may be,
        No magic shall sever
          Thy music from thee.
        Thou hast bound many eyes
          In a dreamy sleep—
        But the strains still arise
          Which thy vigilance keep—
        The sound of the rain
          Which leaps down to the flower,
        And dances again
          In the rhythm of the shower—
        The murmur that springs
          From the growing of grass
        Are the music of things—
          But are modelled, alas!—
        Away, then, my dearest,
          O! hie thee away
        To springs that lie clearest
          Beneath the moon-ray—
        To lone lake that smiles,
          In its dream of deep rest,
        At the many star-isles
          That enjewel its breast—
        Where wild flowers, creeping,
          Have mingled their shade,
        On its margin is sleeping
          Full many a maid—
        Some have left the cool glade, and
          Have slept with the bee—
        Arouse them, my maiden,
          On moorland and lea—
        Go! breathe on their slumber,
          All softly in ear,
        The musical number
          They slumbered to hear—
        For what can awaken
          An angel so soon
        Whose sleep hath been taken
          Beneath the cold moon,
        As the spell which no slumber
          Of witchery may test,
        The rhythmical number
          Which lulled him to rest?”

  Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,
  A thousand seraphs burst th’ Empyrean thro’,
  Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight—
  Seraphs in all but “Knowledge,” the keen light
  That fell, refracted, thro’ thy bounds afar,
  O Death! from eye of God upon that star:
  Sweet was that error—sweeter still that death—
  Sweet was that error—ev’n with _us_ the breath
  Of Science dims the mirror of our joy—
  To them ’twere the Simoom, and would destroy.
  For what (to them) availeth it to know
  That Truth is Falsehood—or that Bliss is Woe?
  Sweet was their death—with them to die was rife
  With the last ecstasy of satiate life—
  Beyond that death no immortality—
  But sleep that pondereth and is not “to be”—
  And there—oh! may my weary spirit dwell—
  Apart from Heaven’s Eternity—and yet how far from Hell!

  What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim,
  Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
  But two: they fell: for Heaven no grace imparts
  To those who hear not for their beating hearts.
  A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover—
  O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)
  Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known?
  Unguided Love hath fallen—’mid “tears of perfect moan.”

  He was a goodly spirit—he who fell:
  A wanderer by moss-y-mantled well—
  A gazer on the lights that shine above—
  A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:
  What wonder? for each star is eye-like there,
  And looks so sweetly down on Beauty’s hair—
  And they, and every mossy spring were holy
  To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.
  The night had found (to him a night of woe)
  Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo—
  Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,
  And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.
  Here sate he with his love—his dark eye bent
  With eagle gaze along the firmament:
  Now turned it upon her—but ever then
  It trembled to the orb of EARTH again.

  “Ianthe, dearest, see! how dim that ray!
  How lovely ’tis to look so far away!
  She seemed not thus upon that autumn eve
  I left her gorgeous halls—nor mourned to leave.
  That eve—that eve—I should remember well—
  The sun-ray dropped, in Lemnos with a spell
  On th’ Arabesque carving of a gilded hall
  Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall—
  And on my eye-lids—O, the heavy light!
  How drowsily it weighed them into night!
  On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran
  With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:
  But O, that light!—I slumbered—Death, the while,
  Stole o’er my senses in that lovely isle
  So softly that no single silken hair
  Awoke that slept—or knew that he was there.

  “The last spot of Earth’s orb I trod upon
  Was a proud temple called the Parthenon;
  More beauty clung around her columned wall
  Than even thy glowing bosom beats withal,
  And when old Time my wing did disenthral
  Thence sprang I—as the eagle from his tower,
  And years I left behind me in an hour.
  What time upon her airy bounds I hung,
  One half the garden of her globe was flung
  Unrolling as a chart unto my view—
  Tenantless cities of the desert too!
  Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,
  And half I wished to be again of men.”

  “My Angelo! and why of them to be?
  A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee—
  And greener fields than in yon world above,
  And woman’s loveliness—and passionate love.”

  “But list, Ianthe! when the air so soft
  Failed, as my pennoned spirit leapt aloft,
  Perhaps my brain grew dizzy—but the world
  I left so late was into chaos hurled,
  Sprang from her station, on the winds apart,
  And rolled a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.
  Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar,
  And fell—not swiftly as I rose before,
  But with a downward, tremulous motion thro’
  Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!
  Nor long the measure of my falling hours,
  For nearest of all stars was thine to ours—
  Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,
  A red Dædalion on the timid Earth.”

  “We came—and to thy Earth—but not to us
  Be given our lady’s bidding to discuss:
  We came, my love; around, above, below,
  Gay fire-fly of the night, we come and go,
  Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod
  _She_ grants to us as granted by her God.
  But, Angelo, than thine grey Time unfurled
  Never his fairy wing o’er fairer world!
  Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes
  Alone could see the phantom in the skies,
  When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
  Headlong thitherward o’er the starry sea—
  But when its glory swelled upon the sky,
  As glowing Beauty’s bust beneath man’s eye,
  We paused before the heritage of men,
  And thy star trembled—as doth Beauty then!”

  Thus in discourse, the lovers whiled away
  The night that waned and waned and brought no day.
  They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts
  Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.

NOTES TO AL AARAAF

[Illustration]

Page 129. _Al Aaraaf._ A star was discovered by Tycho Brahe which
appeared suddenly in the heavens—attained, in a few days, a brilliancy
surpassing that of Jupiter—then as suddenly disappeared, and has never
been seen since.

Page 130. _Capo Deucato._ On Santa Maura—olim Deucadia.

Page 130. _Her who loved a mortal—and so died._ Sappho.

Page 130. _And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnamed._ This flower is much
noticed by Lewenhoeck and Tournefort. The bee, feeding upon its blossom,
becomes intoxicated.

Page 131. _Clytia._ Clytia—the Chrysanthemum Peruvianum, or, to employ
a better-known term, the turnsol—which turns continually towards the
sun, covers itself, like Peru, the country from which it comes, with
dewy clouds, which cool and refresh its flowers during the most violent
heat of the day.—_B. de St. Pierre._

Page 131. _That aspiring flower that sprang on Earth._ There is
cultivated in the king’s garden at Paris, a species of serpentine aloe
without prickles, whose large and beautiful flower exhales a strong
odour of the vanilla, during the time of its expansion, which is very
short. It does not blow till towards the month of July—you then
perceive it gradually open its petals—expand them—fade and die.—_St.
Pierre._

Page 131. _Valisnerian lotus._ There is found, in the Rhone, a beautiful
lily of the Valisnerian kind. Its stem will stretch to the length of
three or four feet—thus preserving its head above water in the
swellings of the river.

Page 131. _Thy most lovely purple perfume._ The Hyacinth.

Page 131. _The Nelumbo bud._ It is a fiction of the Indians, that Cupid
was first seen floating in one of these down the river Ganges, and that
he still loves the cradle of his childhood.

Page 131. _To bear the Goddess’ song, etc._ And golden vials full of
odours which are the prayers of the saints.—_Rev. St. John._

Page 132. _A model of their own._ The Humanitarians held that God was to
be understood as having really a human form.—_Vide Clarke’s Sermons_,
vol. i., page 26, fol. edit.

The drift of Milton’s argument leads him to employ language which would
appear, at first sight, to verge upon their doctrine; but it will be
seen immediately, that he guards himself against the charge of having
adopted one of the most ignorant errors of the dark ages of the
Church.—_Dr. Sumner’s Notes on Milton’s Christian Doctrine._

This opinion, in spite of many testimonies to the contrary, could never
have been very general. Andeus, a Syrian of Mesopotamia, was condemned
for the opinion, as heretical. He lived in the beginning of the fourth
century. His disciples were called Anthropomorphites.—_Vide du Pin._

Among Milton’s minor poems are these lines:

  Dicite sacrorum præsides nemorum Deæ, etc.
  Quis ille primus cujus ex imagine
  Natura solers finxit humanum genus?
  Eternus, incorruptus, æquævus polo,
  Unusque et universus exemplar Dei.

And afterwards—

  Non cui profundum Cæcitas lumen dedit
  Dircæus augur vidit hunc alto sinu, etc.

  Seinem Schosskinde

Page 135. _Sightless cycles._ Sightless—too small to be seen.—_Legge._

Page 135. _Fire-flies._ I have often noticed a peculiar movement of the
fire-flies;—they will collect in a body and fly off, from a common
centre, into innumerable radii.

Page 135. _Therasæan reign._ Therasæa, or Therasea, the island mentioned
by Seneca, which, in a moment, arose from the sea to the eyes of
astonished mariners.

Page 136. _Molten stars, etc._

  Some star which, from the ruined roof
  Of shaked Olympus, by mischance did fall.—_Milton._

Page 137. _Persepolis._ Voltaire, in speaking of Persepolis, says, “Je
connois bien l’admiration qu’inspirent ces ruines—mais un palais érigé
au pied d’une chaîne des rochers sterils—peut il être un chef
d’œuvre des arts?”

Page 137. _Gomorrah._ Ula Deguisi is the Turkish appellation; but, on
its own shores, it is called Bahar Loth, or Almotanah. There were
undoubtedly more than two cities engulphed in the “dead sea.” In the
valley of Siddim were five—Adrah, Zeboin, Zoar, Sodom and Gomorrah.
Stephen of Byzantium mentions eight, and Strabo thirteen (engulfed)—but
the last is out of all reason.

It is said [Tacitus, Strabo, Josephus, Daniel of St. Saba, Nau,
Maundrell, Troilo, D’Arvieux], that after an excessive drought, the
vestiges of columns, walls, etc., are seen above the surface. At _any_
season, such remains may be discovered by looking down into the
transparent lake, and at such distances as would argue the existence of
many settlements in the space now usurped by the “Asphaltites.”

Page 137. _Eyraco._ Chaldea.

Page 137. _Palpable and loud._ I have often thought I could distinctly
hear the sound of the darkness as it stole over the horizon.

Page 137. _Young flowers were whispering, etc._ Fairies use flowers for
their charactery.—_Merry Wives of Windsor._

Page 138. _The moonbeam._ In Scripture is this passage—“The sun shall
not harm thee by day, nor the moon by night.” It is, perhaps, not
generally known that the moon, in Egypt, has the effect of producing
blindness to those who sleep with the face exposed to its rays, to which
circumstance the passage evidently alludes.

Page 139. _The lone Albatross._ The Albatross is said to sleep on the
wing.

Page 139. _The murmur that springs, etc._ I met with this idea in an
old English tale, which I am now unable to obtain and quote from
memory:—“The verie essence and, as it were, springe-heade and origine
of all musiche is the verie pleasaunte sounde which the trees of the
forest do make when they growe.”

Page 140. _Have slept with the bee._ The wild bee will not sleep in the
shade if there be moonlight.

The rhyme in this verse, as in one about sixty lines before, has an
appearance of affectation. It is, however, imitated from Sir W. Scott,
or rather from Claud Halcro—in whose mouth I admired its effect:

  O! were there an island,
    Tho’ ever so wild,
  Where woman might smile, and
    No man be beguiled, etc.

Page 141. _Apart from Heaven’s Eternity—and yet how far from Hell._
With the Arabians there is a medium between Heaven and Hell, where men
suffer no punishment, but yet do not attain that tranquil and even
happiness which they suppose to be characteristic of heavenly enjoyment.

  Un no rompido sueno—
  Un dia puro—allegre—libre
  Quiera—
  Libre de amor—de zelo—
  De odio—de esperanza—de rezelo.
                    _Luis Ponce de Leon._

Sorrow is not excluded from “Al Aaraaf,” but it is that sorrow which the
living love to cherish for the dead, and which, in some minds, resembles
the delirium of opium. The passionate excitement of Love and the
buoyancy of spirit attendant upon intoxication are its less holy
pleasures—the price of which, to those souls who make choice of “Al
Aaraaf” as their residence after life, is final death and annihilation.

Page 141. _Tears of perfect moan._

  There be tears of perfect moan
  Wept for thee in Helicon.—_Milton._

Page 142. _The Parthenon._ It was entire in 1687—the most elevated spot
in Athens.

Page 142. _More beauty clung, etc._

  Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows
  Than have the white breasts of the Queen of Love.

SCENES FROM POLITIAN

SCENES FROM “POLITIAN”

[Illustration]


I

     ROME.—A Hall in a Palace. ALESSANDRA and CASTIGLIONE.

  _Alessandra._ Thou art sad, Castiglione.

  _Castiglione._                           Sad!—not I.
  Oh, I’m the happiest, happiest man in Rome!
  A few days more, thou knowest, my Alessandra,
  Will make thee mine. Oh, I am very happy!

  _Aless._ Methinks thou hast a singular way of showing
  Thy happiness—what ails thee, cousin of mine?
  Why didst thou sigh so deeply?

  _Cas._                         Did I sigh?
  I was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,
  A silly—a most silly fashion I have
  When I am _very_ happy. Did I sigh? (_sighing._)

  _Aless._ Thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged
  Too much of late, and I am vexed to see it.
  Late hours and wine, Castiglione,—these
  Will ruin thee! thou art already altered—
  Thy looks are haggard—nothing so wears away
  The constitution as late hours and wine.

  _Cas._ (_musing_). Nothing, fair cousin, nothing—not even deep sorrow—
  Wears it away like evil hours and wine.
  I will amend.

  _Aless._      Do it! I would have thee drop
  Thy riotous company, too—fellows low born;
  Ill suit the like with old Di Broglio’s heir
  And Alessandra’s husband.

  _Cas._                    I will drop them.

  _Aless._ Thou wilt—thou must. Attend thou also more
  To thy dress and equipage—they are over plain
  For thy lofty rank and fashion—much depends
  Upon appearances.

  _Cas._            I’ll see to it.

  _Aless._ Then see to it!—pay more attention, sir,
  To a becoming carriage—much thou wantest
  In dignity.

  _Cas._      Much, much, oh, much I want
  In proper dignity.

  _Aless._ (_haughtily_). Thou mockest me, sir!

  _Cas._ (_abstractedly_). Sweet, gentle Lalage!

  _Aless._                                       Heard I aright?
  I speak to him—he speaks of Lalage!
  Sir Count! (_places her hand on his shoulder_) what art thou dreaming?
    He’s not well!
  What ails thee, sir?

  _Cas._ (_starting_). Cousin! fair cousin!—madam!
  I crave thy pardon—indeed I am not well—
  Your hand from off my shoulder, if you please.
  This air is most oppressive!—Madam—the Duke!

     _Enter Di Broglio._

  _Di Broglio._ My son, I’ve news for thee!—hey?—what’s the matter?
    (_observing Alessandra._)
  I’ the pouts? Kiss her, Castiglione! kiss her,
  You dog! and make it up, I say, this minute!
  I’ve news for you both. Politian is expected
  Hourly in Rome—Politian, Earl of Leicester!
  We’ll have him at the wedding. ’Tis his first visit
  To the imperial city.

  _Aless._              What! Politian
  Of Britain, Earl of Leicester?

  _Di Brog._                     The same, my love.
  We’ll have him at the wedding. A man quite young
  In years, but grey in fame. I have not seen him
  But rumour speaks of him as of a prodigy
  Pre-eminent in arts, and arms, and wealth,
  And high descent. We’ll have him at the wedding.

  _Aless._ I have heard much of this Politian.
  Gay, volatile and giddy—is he not,
  And little given to thinking?

  _Di Brog._                    Far from it, love.
  No branch, they say, of all philosophy
  So deep abstruse he has not mastered it.
  Learnèd as few are learnèd.

  _Aless._                    ’Tis very strange!
  I have known men have seen Politian
  And sought his company. They speak of him
  As of one who entered madly into life,
  Drinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs.

  _Cas._ Ridiculous! Now _I_ have seen Politian
  And know him well—nor learned nor mirthful he.
  He is a dreamer, and a man shut out
  From common passions.

  _Di Brog._            Children, we disagree.
  Let us go forth and taste the fragrant air
  Of the garden. Did I dream, or did I hear
  Politian was a _melancholy_ man? (_Exeunt._)


II

     ROME.—A Lady’s Apartment, with a window open and looking
     into a garden. LALAGE, in deep mourning, reading at a
     table on which lie some books and a hand-mirror. In the
     background JACINTA (a servant maid) leans carelessly upon a
     chair.

  _Lalage._ Jacinta! is it thou?

  _Jacinta_ (_pertly_).          Yes, ma’am, I’m here.

  _Lal._ I did not know, Jacinta, you were in waiting.
  Sit down!—let not my presence trouble you—
  Sit down!—for I am humble, most humble.

  _Jac._ (_aside_). ’Tis time.

     (_Jacinta seats herself in a side-long manner upon the
     chair, resting her elbows upon the back, and regarding her
     mistress with a contemptuous look. Lalage continues to
     read._)

  _Lal._ “It in another climate, so he said,
  Bore a bright golden flower, but not i’ this soil!”

     (_pauses—turns over some leaves, and resumes._)

  “No lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower—
  But Ocean ever to refresh mankind
  Breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind.”
  Oh, beautiful!—most beautiful!—how like
  To what my fevered soul doth dream of Heaven!
  O happy land! (_pauses_) She died!—the maiden died!
  O still more happy maiden who couldst die!
  Jacinta!

     (_Jacinta returns no answer, and Lalage presently resumes._)

           Again!—a similar tale
  Told of a beauteous dame beyond the sea!
  Thus speaketh one Ferdinand in the words of the play—
  “She died full young”—one Bossola answers him—
  “I think not so—her infelicity
  Seemed to have years too many”—Ah, luckless lady!
  Jacinta! (_still no answer_).
           Here’s a far sterner story—
  But like—oh, very like in its despair—
  Of that Egyptian queen, winning so easily
  A thousand hearts—losing at length her own.
  She died. Thus endeth the history—and her maids
  Lean over her and weep—two gentle maids
  With gentle names—Eiros and Charmion!
  Rainbow and Dove!—Jacinta!

  _Jac._ (_pettishly_).      Madam, what _is_ it?

  _Lal._ Wilt thou, my good Jacinta, be so kind
  As go down in the library and bring me
  The Holy Evangelists?

  _Jac._                Pshaw! (_Exit._)

  _Lal._                       If there be balm
  For the wounded spirit in Gilead, it is there!
  Dew in the night time of my bitter trouble
  Will there be found—“dew sweeter far than that
  Which hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill.”

     (_re-enter Jacinta, and throws a volume on the table._)

  _Jac._ There, ma’am, ’s the book. (_aside._) Indeed she is very
    troublesome.

  _Lal._ (_astonished_). What didst thou say, Jacinta? Have I done aught
  To grieve thee or to vex thee?—I am sorry.
  For thou hast served me long and ever been
  Trustworthy and respectful. (_resumes her reading._)

  _Jac._ (_aside._)           I can’t believe
  She has any more jewels—no—no—she gave me all.

  _Lal._ What didst thou say, Jacinta? Now I bethink me
  Thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding.
  How fares good Ugo?—and when is it to be?
  Can I do aught?—is there no further aid
  Thou needest, Jacinta?

  _Jac._ (_aside._)      Is there no _further_ aid?
  That’s meant for me. (_aloud._) I’m sure, madam, you need not
  Be always throwing those jewels in my teeth.

  _Lal._ Jewels! Jacinta,—now indeed, Jacinta,
  I thought not of the jewels.

  _Jac._                       Oh, perhaps not!
  But then I might have sworn it. After all,
  There’s Ugo says the ring is only paste,
  For he’s sure the Count Castiglione never
  Would have given a real diamond to such as you;
  And at the best I’m certain, madam, you cannot
  Have use for jewels _now_. But I might have sworn it. (_Exit._)

     (_Lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the
     table—after a short pause raises it._)

  _Lal._ Poor Lalage!—and is it come to this?
  Thy servant maid!—but courage!—’tis but a viper
  Whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul!
  (_taking up the mirror._)
  Ha! here at least’s a friend—too much a friend
  In earlier days—a friend will not deceive thee.
  Fair mirror and true! now tell me (for thou canst)
  A tale—a pretty tale—and heed thou not
  Though it be rife with woe. It answers me.
  It speaks of sunken eyes, and wasted cheeks,
  And Beauty long deceased—remembers me,
  Of Joy departed—Hope, the Seraph Hope,
  Inurnèd and entombed!—now, in a tone
  Low, sad, and solemn, but most audible,
  Whispers of early grave untimely yawning
  For ruined maid. Fair mirror and true!—thou liest not!
  _Thou_ hast no end to gain—no heart to break—
  Castiglione lied who said he loved——
  Thou true—he false!—false!—false!

     (_While she speaks, a monk enters her apartment and
     approaches unobserved._)

[Illustration]

  _Monk._                           Refuge thou hast,
  Sweet daughter! in Heaven. Think of eternal things!
  Give up thy soul to penitence, and pray!

  _Lal._ (_arising hurriedly_). I _cannot_ pray!—My soul is at war
    with God!
  The frightful sounds of merriment below
  Disturb my senses—go! I cannot pray—
  The sweet airs from the garden worry me!
  Thy presence grieves me—go!—thy priestly raiment
  Fills me with dread—thy ebony crucifix
  With horror and awe!

  _Monk._              Think of thy precious soul!

  _Lal._ Think of my early days!—think of my father
  And mother in Heaven! think of our quiet home,
  And the rivulet that ran before the door!
  Think of my little sisters!—think of them!
  And think of me!—think of my trusting love
  And confidence—his vows—my ruin—think—think
  Of my unspeakable misery!——begone!
  Yet stay! yet stay!—what was it thou saidst of prayer
  And penitence? Didst thou not speak of faith
  And vows before the throne?

  _Monk._                     I did.

  _Lal._                             ’Tis well.
  There _is_ a vow ’twere fitting should be made—
  A sacred vow, imperative and urgent,
  A solemn vow!

  _Monk._       Daughter, this zeal is well!

  _Lal._ Father, this zeal is anything but well!
  Hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing?
  A crucifix whereon to register
  This sacred vow? (_he hands her his own._)
  Not that—Oh! no!—no!—no! (_shuddering._)
  Not that! Not that!—I tell thee, holy man,
  Thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me!
  Stand back! I have a crucifix myself,—
  _I_ have a crucifix! Methinks ’twere fitting
  The deed—the vow—the symbol of the deed—
  And the deed’s register should tally, father!
  (_draws a cross-handled dagger and raises it on high._)
  Behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine
  Is written in Heaven!

  _Monk._               Thy words are madness, daughter,
  And speak a purpose unholy—thy lips are livid—
  Thine eyes are wild—tempt not the wrath divine!
  Pause ere too late!—oh, be not—be not rash!
  Swear not the oath—oh, swear it not!

  _Lal._ ’Tis sworn!


III

     An Apartment in a Palace. POLITIAN and BALDAZZAR.

  _Baldazzar._ Arouse thee now, Politian!
  Thou must not—nay indeed, indeed, thou shalt not
  Give way unto these humours. Be thyself!
  Shake off the idle fancies that beset thee,
  And live, for now thou diest!

  _Politian._                   Not so, Baldazzar!
  Surely I live.

  _Bal._         Politian, it doth grieve me
  To see thee thus!

  _Pol._            Baldazzar, it doth grieve me
  To give thee cause for grief, my honoured friend.
  Command me, sir! what wouldst thou have me do?
  At thy behest I will shake off that nature
  Which from my forefathers I did inherit,
  Which with my mother’s milk I did imbibe,
  And be no more Politian, but some other.
  Command me, sir!

  _Bal._           To the field then—to the field—
  To the senate or the field.

  _Pol._                      Alas! alas!
  There is an imp would follow me even there!
  There is an imp _hath_ followed me even there!
  There is——what voice was that?

  _Bal._                         I heard it not.
  I heard not any voice except thine own,
  And the echo of thine own.

  _Pol._                     Then I but dreamed.

  _Bal._ Give not thy soul to dreams: the camp—the court
  Befit thee—Fame awaits thee—Glory calls—
  And her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear
  In hearkening to imaginary sounds
  And phantom voices.

  _Pol._              It _is_ a phantom voice!
  Didst thou not hear it _then_?

  _Bal._                         I heard it not.

  _Pol._ Thou heardst it not!——Baldazzar, speak no more
  To me, Politian, of thy camps and courts.
  Oh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,
  Of the hollow and high-sounding vanities
  Of the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile!
  We have been boys together—school-fellows—
  And now are friends—yet shall not be so long—
  For in the Eternal City thou shalt do me
  A kind and gentle office, and a Power—
  A Power august, benignant, and supreme—
  Shall then absolve thee of all further duties
  Unto thy friend.

  _Bal._           Thou speakest a fearful riddle
  I _will_ not understand.

  _Pol._                   Yet now as Fate
  Approaches, and the Hours are breathing low,
  The sands of Time are changed to golden grains,
  And dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!
  I _cannot_ die, having within my heart
  So keen a relish for the beautiful
  As hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air
  Is balmier now than it was wont to be—
  Rich melodies are floating in the winds—
  A rarer loveliness bedecks the earth—
  And with a holier lustre the quiet moon
  Sitteth in Heaven.—Hist! hist! thou canst not say
  Thou hearest not _now_, Baldazzar?

  _Bal._                             Indeed I hear not.

  _Pol._ Not hear it!—listen now—listen!—the faintest sound
  And yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!
  A lady’s voice!—and sorrow in the tone!
  Baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!
  Again!—again!—how solemnly it falls
  Into my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice
  Surely I never heard—yet it were well
  Had I but heard it with its thrilling tones
  In earlier days!

  _Bal._           I myself hear it now.
  Be still!—the voice, if I mistake not greatly,
  Proceeds from yonder lattice—which you may see
  Very plainly through the window—it belongs,
  Does it not? unto this palace of the Duke.
  The singer is undoubtedly beneath
  The roof of his Excellency—and perhaps
  Is even that Alessandra of whom he spoke
  As the betrothèd of Castiglione,
  His son and heir.

  _Pol._            Be still!—it comes again!

  _Voice_ (_very faintly_). “And is thy heart so strong
      As for to leave me thus,
      That have loved thee so long,
      In wealth and woe among?
      And is thy heart so strong
      As for to leave me thus?
                  Say nay! say nay!”

  _Bal._ The song is English, and I oft have heard it
  In merry England—never so plaintively—
  Hist! hist! it comes again!

  _Voice_ (_more loudly_). “Is it so strong
      As for to leave me thus,
      That have loved thee so long,
      In wealth and woe among?
      And is thy heart so strong
      As for to leave me thus?
                  Say nay! say nay!”

  _Bal._ ’Tis hushed and all is still!

  _Pol._                               All _is not_ still.

  _Bal._ Let us go down.

  _Pol._                 Go down, Baldazzar, go!

  _Bal._ The hour is growing late—the Duke awaits us,—
  Thy presence is expected in the hall
  Below. What ails thee, Earl Politian?

  _Voice_ (_distinctly_). “Who have loved thee so long,
      In wealth and woe among,
      And is thy heart so strong?
                  Say nay! say nay!”

  _Bal._ Let us descend!—’tis time. Politian, give
  These fancies to the wind. Remember, pray,
  Your bearing lately savoured much of rudeness
  Unto the Duke. Arouse thee! and remember!

  _Pol._ Remember? I do. Lead on! I _do_ remember. (_going._)
  Let us descend. Believe me I would give,
  Freely would give the broad lands of my earldom
  To look upon the face hidden by yon lattice—
  “To gaze upon that veilèd face, and hear
  Once more that silent tongue.”

  _Bal._                         Let me beg you, sir,
  Descend with me—the Duke may be offended.
  Let us go down, I pray you.

  _Voice_ (_loudly_).         “Say nay!—say nay!”

  _Pol._ (_aside_). ’Tis strange!—’tis very strange—methought the voice
  Chimed in with my desires and bade me stay!
  (_approaching the window._)
  Sweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.
  Now be this Fancy, by Heaven, or be it Fate,
  Still will I not descend. Baldazzar, make
  Apology unto the Duke for me;
  I go not down to-night.

  _Bal._                  Your lordship’s pleasure
  Shall be attended to. Good-night, Politian.

  _Pol._ Good-night, my friend, good-night.


IV

     The Gardens of a Palace—Moonlight. LALAGE and POLITIAN.

  _Lalage._ And dost thou speak of love
  To _me_, Politian?—dost thou speak of love
  To Lalage?—ah woe—ah woe is me!
  This mockery is most cruel—most cruel indeed!

  _Politian._ Weep not! oh, sob not thus!—thy bitter tears
  Will madden me. Oh, mourn not, Lalage—
  Be comforted! I know—I know it all,
  And _still_ I speak of love. Look at me, brightest,
  And beautiful Lalage!—turn here thine eyes!
  Thou askest me if I could speak of love,
  Knowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen.
  Thou askest me that—and thus I answer thee—
  Thus on my bended knee I answer thee. (_kneeling._)
  Sweet Lalage, _I love thee_—_love thee_—_love thee_;
  Thro’ good and ill—thro’ weal and woe, _I love thee_.
  Not mother, with her first-born on her knee,
  Thrills with intenser love than I for thee.
  Not on God’s altar, in any time or clime,
  Burned there a holier fire than burneth now
  Within my spirit for _thee_. And do I love? (_arising._)
  Even for thy woes I love thee—even for thy woes—
  Thy beauty and thy woes.

  _Lal._                   Alas, proud Earl,
  Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!
  How, in thy father’s halls, among the maidens
  Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,
  Could the dishonoured Lalage abide?
  Thy wife, and with a tainted memory?—
  My seared and blighted name, how would it tally
  With the ancestral honours of thy house,
  And with thy glory?

  _Pol._              Speak not to me of glory!
  I hate—I loathe the name; I do abhor
  The unsatisfactory and ideal thing.
  Art thou not Lalage, and I Politian?
  Do I not love—art thou not beautiful—
  What need we more? Ha! glory! now speak not of it:
  By all I hold most sacred and most solemn—
  By all my wishes now—my fears hereafter—
  By all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven—
  There is no deed I would more glory in,
  Than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory
  And trample it under foot. What matters it—
  What matters it, my fairest, and my best,
  That we go down unhonoured and forgotten
  Into the dust—so we descend together?
  Descend together—and then—and then perchance—

  _Lal._ Why dost thou pause, Politian?

  _Pol._                                And then perchance
  _Arise_ together, Lalage, and roam
  The starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,
  And still—

  _Lal._     Why dost thou pause, Politian?

  _Pol._ And still _together_—_together_!

  _Lal._                                  Now, Earl of Leicester!
  Thou _lovest_ me, and in my heart of hearts
  I feel thou lovest me truly.

  _Pol._                       O Lalage!
  (_throwing himself upon his knee._)
  And lovest thou _me_?

  _Lal._                Hist! hush! within the gloom
  Of yonder trees methought a figure passed—
  A spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless—
  Like the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless.
  (_walks across and returns._)
  I was mistaken—’twas but a giant bough
  Stirred by the autumn wind. Politian!

  _Pol._ My Lalage—my love! why art thou moved?
  Why dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience’ self,
  Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,
  Should shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind
  Is chilly—and these melancholy boughs
  Throw over all things a gloom.

  _Lal._                         Politian!
  Thou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land
  With which all tongues are busy—a land new found—
  Miraculously found by one of Genoa—
  A thousand leagues within the golden west?
  A fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,—
  And crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,
  And mountains, around whose towering summits the winds
  Of Heaven untrammelled flow—which air to breathe
  Is Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter
  In days that are to come?

  _Pol._                    Oh, wilt thou—wilt thou
  Fly to that Paradise—my Lalage, wilt thou
  Fly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,
  And Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all.
  And life shall then be mine, for I will live
  For thee, and in thine eyes—and thou shalt be
  No more a mourner—but the radiant Joys
  Shall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope
  Attend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee
  And worship thee, and call thee my beloved,
  My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,
  My all;—oh, wilt thou—wilt thou, Lalage,
  Fly thither with me?

  _Lal._               A deed is to be done—
  Castiglione lives!

  _Pol._             And he shall die! (_Exit._)

  _Lal._ (_after a pause_). And—he—shall—die!——alas!
  Castiglione die? Who spoke the words?
  Where am I?—what was it he said?—Politian!
  Thou _art_ not gone—thou art not _gone_, Politian!
  I _feel_ thou art not gone—yet dare not look,
  Lest I behold thee not—thou _couldst_ not go
  With those words upon thy lips—oh, speak to me!
  And let me hear thy voice—one word—one word,
  To say thou art not gone,—one little sentence,
  To say how thou dost scorn—how thou dost hate
  My womanly weakness. Ha! ha! thou _art_ not gone—
  Oh, speak to me! I _knew_ thou wouldst not go!
  I knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, _durst_ not go.
  Villain, thou _art_ not gone—thou mockest me!
  And thus I clutch thee—thus!——He is gone, he is gone—
  Gone—gone. Where am I?——’tis well—’tis very well!
  So that the blade be keen—the blow be sure,
  ’Tis well, ’tis _very_ well—alas! alas!


V

     The Suburbs. POLITIAN alone.

  _Politian._ This weakness grows upon me. I am faint,
  And much I fear me, ill—it will not do
  To die ere I have lived!—Stay—stay thy hand,
  O Azrael, yet awhile!—Prince of the Powers
  Of Darkness and the Tomb, oh, pity me!
  Oh, pity me! let me not perish now,
  In the budding of my Paradisal Hope!
  Give me to live yet—yet a little while:
  ’Tis I who pray for life—I who so late
  Demanded but to die!—What sayeth the Count?

     _Enter Baldazzar._

  _Baldazzar._ That, knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud
  Between the Earl Politian and himself,
  He doth decline your cartel.

  _Pol._                       _What_ didst thou say?
  What answer was it you brought me, good Baldazzar?
  With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes
  Laden from yonder bowers!—a fairer day,
  Or one more worthy Italy, methinks
  No mortal eyes have seen!—_what_ said the Count?

  _Bal._ That he, Castiglione, not being aware
  Of any feud existing, or any cause
  Of quarrel between your lordship and himself,
  Cannot accept the challenge.

  _Pol._                       It is most true—
  All this is very true. When saw you, sir,
  When saw you now, Baldazzar, in the frigid
  Ungenial Britain which we left so lately,
  A heaven so calm as this—so utterly free
  From the evil taint of clouds?—and he did say?

  _Bal._ No more, my lord, than I have told you:
  The Count Castiglione will not fight,
  Having no cause for quarrel.

  _Pol._                       Now this is true—
  All very true. Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,
  And I have not forgotten it—thou’lt do me
  A piece of service; wilt thou go back and say
  Unto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,
  Hold him a villain?—thus much, I pr’ythee, say
  Unto the Count—it is exceeding just
  He should have cause for quarrel.

  _Bal._                            My lord!—my friend!——

  _Pol._ (_aside_). ’Tis he—he comes himself! (_aloud._)
    Thou reasonest well.
  I know what thou wouldst say—not send the message—
  Well!—I will think of it—I will not send it.
  Now pr’ythee, leave me—hither doth come a person
  With whom affairs of a most private nature
  I would adjust.

  _Bal._          I go—to-morrow we meet,
  Do we not?—at the Vatican.

  _Pol._                     At the Vatican. (_Exit Baldazzar._)

     _Enter Castiglione._

  _Cas._ The Earl of Leicester here!

  _Pol._ I _am_ the Earl of Leicester, and thou seest,
  Dost thou not? that I am here.

  _Cas._                         My lord, some strange,
  Some singular mistake—misunderstanding—
  Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged
  Thereby, in heat of anger, to address
  Some words most unaccountable, in writing,
  To me, Castiglione; the bearer being
  Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware
  Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,
  Having given thee no offence. Ha!—am I right?
  ’Twas a mistake?—undoubtedly—we all
  Do err at times.

  _Pol._ Draw, villain, and prate no more!

  _Cas._ Ha!—draw?—and villain? have at thee then at once,
  Proud Earl! (_draws._)

  _Pol._ (_drawing_). Thus to the expiatory tomb,
  Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee
  In the name of Lalage!

  _Cas._ (_letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of the
    stage._)
                         Of Lalage!
  Hold off—thy sacred hand!—avaunt, I say!
  Avaunt—I will not fight thee—indeed I dare not.

  _Pol._ Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?
  Shall I be baffled thus?—now this is well;
  Didst say thou _darest_ not? Ha!

  _Cas._                           I dare not—dare not—
  Hold off thy hand—with that belovèd name
  So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee—
  I cannot—dare not—

  _Pol._             Now, by my halidom,
  I do believe thee!—coward, I do believe thee!

  _Cas._ Ha!—coward!—this may not be!

     (_clutches his sword and staggers towards Politian, but his
     purpose is changed before reaching him, and he falls upon
     his knee at the feet of the Earl._)

                                      Alas! my lord,
  It is—it is—most true. In such a cause
  I am the veriest coward. Oh, pity me!

  _Pol._ (_greatly softened_). Alas!—I do—indeed I pity thee.

  _Cas._ And Lalage——

  _Pol._              Scoundrel!—arise and die!

  _Cas._ It needeth not be—thus—thus—Oh, let me die
  Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting
  That in this deep humiliation I perish.
  For in the fight I will not raise a hand
  Against thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home—
  (_baring his bosom._)
  Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon—
  Strike home. I will not fight thee.

  _Pol._ Now’s Death and Hell!
  Am I not—am I not sorely—grievously tempted
  To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir:
  Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare
  For public insult in the streets—before
  The eyes of the citizens. I’ll follow thee—
  Like an avenging spirit I’ll follow thee
  Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest—
  Before all Rome I’ll taunt thee, villain,—I’ll taunt thee,
  Dost hear? with cowardice—thou wilt not fight me?
  Thou liest! thou shalt! (_Exit._)

  _Cas._ Now this indeed is just!
  Most righteous, and most just, avenging Heaven!
