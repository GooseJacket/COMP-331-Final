1	Indeed [CM] [PN] [CM] you will be as welcome to me as either of them [P] [PB] The wedding took place [CN] the bride and bridegroom set off for [PN] from the church door [CM] and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual [P] [PN] soon heard from her friend [CM] and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been [CN] that it should be equally unreserved was impossible [P] [PN] could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over [S] and [CM] though determined not to slacken as a correspondent [CM] it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was [P] [PN] s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness [CN] there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home [CM] how she would like [PN] [PN] [CM] and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be [S] though [CM] when the letters were read [CM] [PN] felt that [PN] expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen [P] She wrote cheerfully [CM] seemed surrounded with comforts [CM] and mentioned nothing which she could not praise [P] The house [CM] furniture [CM] neighbourhood [CM] and roads [CM] were all to her taste [CM] and [PN] [PN] s behaviour was most friendly and obliging [P] It was [PN] [P] [PN] s picture of [PN] and [PN] rationally softened [S] and [PN] perceived that she must wait for her own visit there [CM] to know the rest [P] [PB] [PN] had already written a few lines to her sister [CM] to announce their safe arrival in [PN] [S] and when she wrote again [CM] [PN] hoped it would be in her power to say something of the [PN] [P] [PB] Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is [P] [PN] had been a week in town [CM] without either seeing or hearing from [PN] [P] She accounted for it [CM] however [CM] by supposing that her last letter to her friend from [PN] had by some accident been lost [P] [PB] My aunt [CM] she continued [CM] is going to[NL]
1	It seemed no longer a tower [CM] no longer supported by earth [CM] but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the [PN] sky [P] Its brightness mesmerized her [CM] still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home [P] [PB] Then something did happen [P] [PB] Two [PN] by the [PN] had been bickering about a debt [P] Cinque lire [CM] they had cried [CM] cinque lire [E] They sparred at each other [CM] and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest [P] He frowned [S] he bent towards [PN] with a look of interest [CM] as if he had an important message for her [P] He opened his lips to deliver it [CM] and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin [P] [PB] That was all [P] A crowd rose out of the dusk [P] It hid this extraordinary man from her [CM] and bore him away to the fountain [P] [PN] [P] [PN] [PN] happened to be a few paces away [CM] looking at her across the spot where the man had been [P] How very odd [E] Across something [P] Even as she caught sight of him he grew dim [S] the palace itself grew dim [CM] swayed above her [CM] fell on to her softly [CM] slowly [CM] noiselessly [CM] and the sky fell with it [P] [PB] She thought [CN] Oh [CM] what have I done [QN] [PB] Oh [CM] what have I done [QN] she murmured [CM] and opened her eyes [P] [PB] [PN] [PN] still looked at her [CM] but not across anything [P] She had complained of dullness [CM] and [PN] [E] one man was stabbed [CM] and another held her in his arms [P] [PB] They were sitting on some steps in the [PN] [PN] [P] He must have carried her [P] He rose when she spoke [CM] and began to dust his knees [P] She repeated [CN] [PB] Oh [CM] what have I done [QN] [PB] You fainted [P] [PB] I I am very sorry [P] [PB] How are you now [QN] [PB] Perfectly well absolutely well [P] And she began to nod and smile [P] [PB] Then let us come home[NL]
1	On the supposition that [PN] [CM] as already hinted [CM] was of demon origin [CM] these good people not unreasonably argued that a Christian interest in the mother s soul required them to remove such a stumbling [D] block from her path [P] If the child [CM] on the other hand [CM] were really capable of moral and religious growth [CM] and possessed the elements of ultimate salvation [CM] then [CM] surely [CM] it would enjoy all the fairer prospect of these advantages [CM] by being transferred to wiser and better guardianship than [PN] [PN] s [P] Among those who promoted the design [CM] [PN] [PN] was said to be one of the most busy [P] It may appear singular [CM] and indeed [CM] not a little ludicrous [CM] that an affair of this kind [CM] which [CM] in later days [CM] would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction than that of the selectmen of the town [CM] should then have been a question publicly discussed [CM] and on which statesmen of eminence took sides [P] At that epoch of pristine simplicity [CM] however [CM] matters of even slighter public interest [CM] and of far less intrinsic weight [CM] than the welfare of [PN] and her child [CM] were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state [P] The period was hardly [CM] if at all [CM] earlier than that of our story [CM] when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony [CM] but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature [P] [PB] Full of concern [CM] therefore [CM] but so conscious of her own right that it seemed scarcely an unequal match between the public [CM] on the one side [CM] and a lonely woman [CM] backed by the sympathies of nature [CM] on the other [CM] [PN] [PN] set forth from her solitary cottage [P] [PN] [PN] [CM] of course [CM] was her companion [P] She was now of an age to run lightly along by her mother s side [CM] and [CM] constantly in motion [CM] from morn till sunset [CM] could have accomplished a much longer journey than that before her[NL]
