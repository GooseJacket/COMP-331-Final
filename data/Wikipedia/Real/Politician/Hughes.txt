Charles Evans Hughes, Sr. (April 11, 1862 – August 27, 1948) was an American lawyer and Republican Party politician from New York.

Hughes served as the 36th Governor of New York (1907–1910), an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1910–1916), a United States Secretary of State (1921–1925), a judge on the Court of International Justice (1928–1930), and the 11th Chief Justice of the United States (1930–1941). The Republican Party's candidate in the 1916 presidential election, he lost narrowly to the Democratic Party's cndidate, Woodrow Wilson.

Hughes was a professor in the 1890s, a supporter of Britain's New Liberalism,[2] an important leader of the progressive movement of the 20th century, a leading diplomat and New York lawyer in the days of Harding and Coolidge, and a well-known swing voter in dealing with cases related to the New Deal in the 1930s.[2] The historian Clinton Rossiter hailed him as a leading American conservative.[3]

On August 27, 1948, Hughes died in what is now the Tiffany Cottage of the Wianno Club, near Barnstable, Massachusetts. His remains are buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.[4]
