Henry Agard Wallace (October 7, 1888 – November 18, 1965) was the 33rd vice president of the United States (1941–1945). He was also the eleventh Secretary of Agriculture (1933–1940). In addition, he was the tenth Secretary of Commerce (1945–1846).

In 1948, he ran for president as a member of the Progressive Party because he thought that President Harry S. Truman was not left-wing enough and too hard on the Soviet Union. However, after the Korean War, he changed his mind and supported the Cold War.
