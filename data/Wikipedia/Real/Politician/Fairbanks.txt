Charles Warren Fairbanks (May 11, 1852 – June 4, 1918) was an American politician. He was a U.S. senator from Indiana, serving from 1897 to 1905, and the 26th vice president of the United States from 1905 to 1909. He also was the vice presidential nominee in the 1916 presidential election for the Republican Party.

Fairbanks was born in Unionville Center, Ohio, on May 11 1852. After he graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University, he moved to Indianapolis, Indiana. He became an attorney and worked as a railroad financier. In 1897, he was elected to the U.S. Senate. During his time there, he assisted President William McKinley and was also part of a commission to fix a disagreement on the Alaska boundary.

In 1904, Fairbanks was chosen to be the running mate for President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1908, he tried to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee for the Republican Party, but he was not chosen. In 1912, he supported William Howard Taft for president. He again tried to become the nominee for president in 1916 but lost to Charles Evan Hughes. He ended up as Hughes's vice presidential nominee for the election, but their ticket lost to the Democratic Party's ticket of President Woodrow Wilson and Vice President Thomas R. Marshall. Fairbanks died of nephritis in Indianapolis at age 66
