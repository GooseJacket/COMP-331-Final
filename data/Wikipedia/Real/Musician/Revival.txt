Creedence Clearwater Revival (often made shorter as CCR or Creedence) was an American rock band from California, United States. They were popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[1] The band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone.[2] CCR was inducted into (became part of) the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.[3]

Many people thought they were from the Southeastern United States because the group's music sounded like the country, folk, and blues music of that place. They liked to sing about bayous, the Mississippi River, catfish, and other things people in the south liked. They also used instruments and styles that were common in the southeast.

For many people, CCR was the soundtrack of their youth. The documentary "Travelin' Band: Creedence Clearwater Revival at the Royal Albert Hall" shows CCR was famous worldwide.. In 1969, they made three albums that made the top fifteen.[4] Cosmos Factory (1970) sold as many or more albums as the Beatles‘ Let It Be and Led Zeppelin‘s III. [5] Their guitar playing and John Fogerty's voice made any CCR song instantly recognizable.

The members of the group were John Fogerty (born 1945), his brother Tom Fogerty (1941-1990), Doug Clifford (born 1945), and Stu Cook (born 1945).
