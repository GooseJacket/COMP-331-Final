Buddy Holly (born in Lubbock, Texas as Charles Hardin Holley, September 7, 1936 – February 3, 1959) was an American rock and roll singer–songwriter. In April 1959, he had a number one song (after death) on UK Singles Chart music chart.[1] He wrote "That'll Be the Day"; In 1957 the song when played by The Crickets, went to number one on Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart.

Holly was important in the history of rock and roll music overall, and in the sub genre, rockabilly music.

Holly played several different types of instruments. His style was influenced by gospel music, country music, and rhythm and blues. The style of his music shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. His group were called The Crickets.

Buddy Holly died on February 3, 1959 when a Beechcraft Bonanza 35 airplane carrying him crashed into a field near Mason City, Iowa. Also killed in the crash were Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson, including pilot Roger Peterson.
In popular culture

Singer Don McLean's popular 1971 song "American Pie" made February 3 known as "The Day the Music Died."
