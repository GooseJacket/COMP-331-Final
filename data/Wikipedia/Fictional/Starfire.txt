Fictional character biography

Within the main continuity of the DC Universe, her origin is revealed to be Princess Koriand'r, an alien princess from the planet Tamaran and heir to the throne until she was ousted in a coup by her elder sister, Komand'r (also known as Blackfire), whom sold her into slavery. Subjected to torture and sexual exploitation, Koriand'r would later receive additional powers following experimentations by alien scientists. Escaping her captors, the character would find herself on Earth and befriended the Teen Titans, becoming a long-lasting member of the team over the years. While on Earth, the character has been depicted as a model under the alias Kory Anders, occasionally the leader of the Teen Titans, and was the principal of Teen Titans Academy during a period in which the Titans help trained future superheroes of the DC Universe.
Powers and abilities

The radiation is then converted to pure energy, allowing her to fly at supersonic speeds. Starfire is capable of using this power to fly in space and even go fast enough to cross several solar systems in minutes to seconds. This energy also gives her incredible superhuman strength and durability.
In other media

Starfire has appeared in many cartoon television shows and movies, including as a member of the Teen Titans in Cartoon Network's eponymous series, voiced by Hynden Walch. She also appears in the DC Universe series Titans, played by Anna Diop.
