Fictional character biography

He has become a member of the mutant group, the X-Men and is a genius despite his animal-like appearance. He is also a mutant and is incredibly agile and strong with distinctive blue fur covering his entire body. In fact, Beast is both the brains and brawn of the team, preferring to think his way out of danger but more than capable of putting up a fight if he feels threatened or that his friends are in danger. He has been taken in a more darker Direction since The Krakon Age.
In other media

The character has appeared in television series, video games, and action figures. He has been adapted into motion pictures and is played by Kelsey Grammer and Nicholas Hoult.
