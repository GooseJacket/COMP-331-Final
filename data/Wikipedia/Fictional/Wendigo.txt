The Wendigo is an evil spirit and monster that appears in many Native American stories. Not all Native Americans believe in the Wendigo and the ones that do live in certain places, such as near the Great Lakes and eastern Canada. It is said to sometimes even have human-like features. It has a hunger for human flesh that can not be satisfied.
