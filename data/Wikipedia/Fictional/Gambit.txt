Cosplayer as Gambit.

Gambit (Remy Étienne LeBeau) is a fictional character who appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in the X-Men series. His mutant power is the ability to control, change and create kinetic energy (moving energy) which means he can make things move at his command. Many scenes in X-Men Origins: Wolverine can demonstrate this.
In other media

Gambit made his live-action debut in the 2009 movie X-Men Origins: Wolverine, portrayed by Taylor Kitsch. Channing Tatum was attached to star in a solo Gambit movie, which remained in development hell for five years and was cancelled upon the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney. Tatum ultimately portrayed the character in the 2024 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movie Deadpool & Wolverine.
