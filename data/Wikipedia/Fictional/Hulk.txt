The Hulk is a popular fictional superhero character created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. His real name is Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a brilliant scientist who transforms into the Hulk—a massive, green-skinned, super-strong creature—whenever he experiences intense anger or stress.
Publication history

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk (May 1962).
Fictional character biography

Dr. Bruce Banner was exposed to gamma radiation during an experimental bomb test, which led to his transformation into the Hulk. The transformation is triggered by emotional stress, especially anger. The Hulk's personality varies from a childlike, innocent version (sometimes called "Savage Hulk") to a more intelligent and articulate persona (like "Professor Hulk").
Powers and abilities

He possesses superhuman strength, durability, and regenerative healing. The Hulk's strength increases with his level of anger. He is resistent to most forms of injury and damage. He also has limited ability to speak when transformed into the Hulk, depending on the version.
Notable stories and roles

Hulk has been a member of the Avengers and the Defenders. He often struggles with controlling his temper and the destructive potential of the Hulk. Key story arcs include Planet Hulk, where he is exiled to a distant planet, and World War Hulk, where he seeks revenge on those who wronged him.
In other media

One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, the character has appeared on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspired real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and been referenced in several media. Banner and the Hulk have been adapted into live-action, animated, and video game incarnations.

The character was first played in live-action by Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno in the 1978 television series The Incredible Hulk and its subsequent television films The Incredible Hulk Returns (1988), The Trial of the Incredible Hulk (1989), and The Death of the Incredible Hulk (1990).
