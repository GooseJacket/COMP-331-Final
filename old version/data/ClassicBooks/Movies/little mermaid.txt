FADE IN:
EXT. A ROUGH SEA - MORNING
A huge three masted ship is buffeted about on the choppy waters.
The ship's burly crew of SAILORS are SINGING lustily as they
batten down hatches and adjust rigging. Some FISHERMEN are
hauling in nets at the sides of the boat and tossing fish into
barrels.
SAILORS
I'LL TELL YOU A TALE OF THE BOTTOMLESS BLUE
AND. IT'S HEY TO THE STARBOARD HEAVE HO
LOOKOUT LAD, A MERMAID BE WAITIN' FER YOU
IN MYSTERIOUS FATHOM'S BELOW
I'LL SING YOU A SONG OF A GIRL FROM THE SEA
AND IT'S HEY TO TH~ STARBOARD HEAVE HO!

IN MYSTERIOUS FATHOMS BELOW
FATHOM'S BELOW! BELOW!
FROM WHENCE WAYWARD WESTERLIES BLOW
WHERE TRITON IS KING AND HIS MERPEOPLE SING
IN MYSTERIOUS FATHOM'S BELOW .•.
A FISHERMAN picks up a large MACKEREL from the net which
suddenly squirms out of the fisherman's hands and drops bac"k
into the ocean
EXT. UNDERWATER
We follow the mackerel as he SPLASHES down under the water. In
contrast to the turbulence above, here it is quiet, calm, and
peaceful. The frightened fish looks b~ck up toward the water's
surface and SHUDDERS, .. shaking off the horror of his ordeal.
Then he t,akes off, swimming far away from the boat. Stirring
ORCHESTRATION SWELLS and the TITLES BEGIN, as we follow the
,mackerel.through a series .of dazzling scenes of natural undersea
life; sweeping panoramas of graceful·mauve anemones, mystic
WHALES, and the tiniest PILOT FISHES.
Suddenly a MERMAN zips through the scene. Then we see a MERMAID
and another MERMAN. The screen is filled with MER PEOPLE. We
follow the mackerel and the mer people as they enter a fantastic
underwater city.made up of numerous coral buildings decorated
with m~ssel.shells and pearls. One gigantlc.structure stands
out. A magnificent palace. The TITLEs·coNCLUDE as the mer
people swim toward the palace.

INT. PALACE CONCERT HALL
We see the various ~er guests arriving in a huge, ornate
auditorium. They are being se.ated by SEA HORSE USHERS. A dozen
SWORDFISH uncross like honor guards as TRITON, the imposing sea
King enters the hall and takes his seat in the royal box. We

INT. BACKSTAGE AREA
In a dressing area behind the curtain, six of the Sea King's
beautiful, elegantly coiffed mermaid DAUGHTERS are loosening up
VOCALLY while wardrobe LOBSTERS adjust sea shells on the_girls
heads. One of the daughters, ARISTA, looks around, perplexed.
ARISTA

EXT. BEACH
Eric is lying unconscious at the edge of the beach. He starts
to stir slightly.
ANGLE ON ARIEL
She is watching Eric longingly from a rock, out in the water,.
a short distance.from the beach. This scene parallels the
earlier scene when Ariel had saved Eric's life and was watching
him from the water.
ANGLE ON TRITON AND SEBASTIAN
They surface and observe Ariel. Triton watches his daughter,
then looks back toward Eric, the object of her heart's desire.
Triton observes them for a long beat. He looks thoughtful.
He turns toward Sebastian.
TRITON
That ••. that human saved my
life •••
The Sea King SIGHS. He is on the verge of making a monumental
descision. He looks over at Sebastian with an attitude that
says, "Should I?" Sebastian understands and nods pleadingly.
The Sea King looks back at his daughter and smiles. He gestures
and a ·magical glow comes out of his trident.
ANGLE ON ARIEL
The magical glow engulfs Ariel, shimmering brightly.
ANGLE ON ERIC
He shakes his head a bit. He is starting to regain
consciousness. Suddenly he hears Ariel's voice SINGING.
ARIEL .(0. S.)

The camera TRUCKS IN tight on the couple
DISSOLVE·TO:
EXT. WEDDING SHIP DAY - DAY
We pull back from the couple kissing and see that it is now a
wedding kiss aboard ship. The couple have just been pronounced
man and wife.
{CONTINUED)
85.
CONT'D:
The entire wedding party aboard the ship, including Carlotta
and Sir Grimsby, are all APPLAUDING and CHEERING jubilantly.
Max encircles .them excitedly. Sebastian and Chef Louis, now
the best.of friends, are sitting beside each other happily
swaying to the music. ·
As the CAMERA conttnues PULLING BACK we see that surrounding
the ship,· in the water, are Ariel's father, sisters, Harold,
and other mer folk, Flounder, an.d other sea creatures~ Scuttle
is soaring above the ship. Everyone is APPLAUDING happily.
The fish are bouncing up and down on the water and CLAPPING
their fins together. ·
Back on ship, Sebastian's blissful smile fades as he looks up
and sees Chef Louis coming right at him, brandishing a big,
shiny knife. Sebastian's eyes roll into his head and he faints
as WHOOSH, the knife.comes do;,n. Pulling back, we see Louis
has just cut a piece. of wedding cake directly below Sebastian's
perch. Sebastian recovers and smiles weakly as Louis offers him
some cake.
Ariel tosses her bridal bouquet out into the ocean. Triton
picks it up. He looks up at his daughter with an expression
of both happiness and sadness. She returns his look. Triton
and all the sea .characters wave to Ariel and Eric as the ship
d·eparts, moving against the horizon. We pull back to an extreme
long shot as a·stirring chorus does a final reprise of "PART
OF YOUR WORLD."
FADE OUT.
