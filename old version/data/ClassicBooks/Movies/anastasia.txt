FADE IN:
on a well-worn PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM. An ELDERLY WOMAN'S
HAND touched the album, caressing it lovingly for a
moment, as WE HEAR her voice.
TATIANA (O.C.)
Once we lived in an enchanted
world. . .
She opend the ALBUM to reveal a BLACK AND WHITE
PHOTOGRAPH of the PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG on a
brilliant summer day.
TATIANA (CONT)
A world of Tsars and Princesses
and elegant palaces. . .
CAMERA MOVES CLOSER TO the picture. . .
TATIANA (CONT)
and grand parties. . .
The PHOTO dissolves into REALITY in brilliant color as
the day turns into night and the summer cools into
winter. We see the palace at night, blanketed in a
beautiful, almost glowing, snow as hourse drawn carriages
pull up to the front door.
TATIANA (CONT)
A beautiful, magical time. . .
MOVE INTO THE PALACE
TATIANA (CONT)
That would soon be gone
forever. . .
INT. PALACE AT ST. PETERSBERG - NIGHT
Elegant ROYALISTS mingle around the MAIN HALL as an
ORCHESTRA plays.
All eyes turn to the GLASS DOORS OF TWO ELEVADORS which
descend grandly on either side of a beautiful staircase.
Through the glass doors we see TATIANA, the Dowager
Empress, 60, imperious and bedecked with jewels, she is
seemingly unapproachable. TSAR NICHOLAS and his SON are
with her. In the other elevador, ALEXANDRA and her
daughters - well, all her daughters except. . .
ANASTASIA, eight years old and apparently late for the
party, rushes down the upstairs hallway followed by a
SERVENT (SONYA) 16, who is trying to catch up with
Anastasia to tie a large ribbon in her long, dark hair.
SONYA
(whispering)
Princess Anastasia - you're
late and it's all my fault!
ANASTASIA
Don't worry, Sonya, no one'll
notice. . .
Just then, Sonya lassoes the ribbon around her hair,
stopping Anastasia with a
ANASTASIA
(loudly)
. . . owwwwwwwww!
All eyes turn to Anastasia, who once she realizes that
she's the center of attention, flashes a mischievous
smile and descends the staircase in grand style. As the
ribbon falls out of her hair and down her back,
Anastasia kicks it to Sonya without breaking stride.
Tatiana sees her and can't help but smile.
The music suddenly becomes a FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS.
SERVENTS open the elevador doors as the ROYAL FAMILY
steps out and begins a proccession through their
subjects. Tatiana holds out her arm to Anastasia as she
makes it to Tatiana's side just in time. Anastasia has
a beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated by
large, blue, mischievous eyes. She an abundance of
energy and confidence for a girl her age.
"THE RULARS OF RUSSIA" (OPENING NUMBER)
The elegant guests sing their admiration as the
beautiful and happy Romanov family makes it's entrance
into the ball, they're "the pride of all Russia".
Vladimir invites Sophie to dance and the entire
glittering assembly assembly swings into a GLORIOUS SWEEPING
WALTZ. Singing their certainty that the Romanovs will
rule forever.
During the above, the ball is in full swing. Beautiful
COUPLES swirls across the dance floor, including
Anastasia dancing gracefully with her father.
Under a long buffet table, we see DMITRI, 11, darkly
handsome, dressed in ragged servant clothes, with a
shock of dark hair which continuoually falls accross his
eyes as watches the guest enviously. Anastasia, still
waltzing with her father, sees him. SERVENTS cross the
room carrying a trays of BEAUTIFUL TROPICAL FRUIT. The
The reliquary is dangling. Anya reaches up to grab on to
it but her aim is off and she HITS it. The reliquary flies
and SMASHES against the side of the tower, shattering.
Rasputin realizes what has happened and scrambles away
in terror.
RASPUTIN (CONT.)
NOOOOOOOOO!
ON BARTOK
who covers his eyes.
ON ANYA AND DMITRI
who climb back up to the platform.
LONG SHOT
of the Eiffel Tower as the EVIL SPIRITS FROM THE
RELIQUARY burst out. The SPIRITS take on all the forms
we've seen earlier: BEARS, MINIONS, SNAKES, and
combinations of all. They grow and swirl, with hideous
MOANING noises.
Anya and Dmitri huddle together, in disbelief.
ON RASPUTIN
as the SPIRITS begin to swarm around him, a TORNADO of
horrid beings. Re screams as they pull him off the
ground.
ON ANYA AND DMITRI
as the force of the tornado increases, they have to
hold on to the girders and each other in order not to
be sucked in. Bartok is thrown against the side of the
tower and slithers to the floor.
ON RASPUTIN
suspended over the Eiffel Tower in the maelstrom. He
Screams wildly as the spirits encircle his, torment
him and EXPLODE - pieces fly and disintegrate in mid-air,
in wild colors and smoke.
ON DMITRI AND ANYA
who hug each other in relief. They stand, looking out.
The smoke dissipates, showing them the city lights below.
ON BARTOK
who rises, patting his chest- He's about to let out
a Bartokism... but all the emerges are LITTLE BAT SQUEAKS.
He's surprised as first, then thrilled. The spell is
broken and he's just a bat again.
DMITRI AND ANYA
as he reaches down and picks up the crown that fell off
her head in the fight. He hands it to her.
DMITRI
Come on... I'll take you home.
Anya looks lovingly at Dmitri and doesn't put the crown back on.
ANYA
I am home.
"HONE IS WHERE YOU ARE"
(The Love Duet For Anya And Dmitri). A SIMPLE EMOTIONAL
BALLAD for two people who realize at last that their hearts
have led then to each other, to "home". This will work within
the dramatic context of the film (sung by the characters) but
can also be re-recorded as a Pop single.
The song continues over various scenes:
THE EMPTY STAGE
Tatiana smiling, knowingly.
SOPHIE & VLADIMIR
sneaking a kiss in the middle of the party. Xenia and Estelle
look at each other with their stone faces.. . and smile.
BARTOK
Hanging from the rafters of the Eiffel Tower, no sure what
to do next - then a cute female bat flies up next to his and
"bats" her eyes.
ANYA & DMITRI
walking over the River bridge with Meetoo following behind
them... a family - going home together.
FADE OUT
