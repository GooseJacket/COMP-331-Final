FADE IN:
NIGHT SEQUENCE
Series of shots of various streets and buildings in the town of
Bedford Falls, somewhere in New York State. The streets are
deserted, and snow is falling. It is Christmas Eve. Over the above
scenes we hear voices praying:
GOWER'S VOICE
I owe everything to George Bailey. Help
him, dear Father.
MARTINI'S VOICE
Joseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my friend Mr.
Bailey.
MRS. BAILEY'S VOICE
Help my son George tonight.
BERT'S VOICE
He never thinks about himself, God; that's
why he's in trouble.
ERNIE'S VOICE
George is a good guy. Give him a break,
God.
MARY'S VOICE
I love him, dear Lord. Watch over him
tonight.
JANIE'S VOICE
Please, God. Something's the matter with
Daddy.
ZUZU'S VOICE
Please bring Daddy back.
CAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through the
sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly toward a
firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we hear the following
heavenly voices talking, and as each voice is heard, one of the
stars twinkles brightly:
FRANKLIN'S VOICE
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
JOSEPH'S VOICE
Looks like we'll have to send someone down
– a lot of people are asking for help for
a man named George Bailey.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial
night. You're right, we'll have to send
someone down immediately. Whose turn is
it?
JOSEPH'S VOICE
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's
that clock-maker's turn again.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE
Oh – Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet,
has he? We've passed him up right along.
JOSEPH'S VOICE
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q.
of a rabbit.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child –
simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
A small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It twinkles
as Clarence speaks:
CLARENCE'S VOICE
You sent for me, sir?
FRANKLIN'S VOICE
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs
our help.
CLARENCE'S VOICE
Splendid! Is he sick?
FRANKLIN'S VOICE
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly
ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time,
that man will be thinking seriously of
throwing away God's greatest gift.
CLARENCE'S VOICE
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only
got an hour to dress. What are they
wearing now?
FRANKLIN'S VOICE
You will spend that hour getting
acquainted with George Bailey.
CLARENCE'S VOICE
Sir... If I should accomplish this mission
– I mean – might I perhaps win my wings?
I've been waiting for over two hundred
years now, sir – and people are beginning
to talk.
PARTRIDGE
There you are, George. I got the faculty
all up out of bed.
(hands his watch to
Zuzu)
And here's something for you to play with.
MAN
(giving money)
I wouldn't have a roof over my head if it
wasn't for you, George.
Ernie is reading a telegram he has just received.
ERNIE
Just a minute. Quiet, everybody. Quiet –
quiet. Now, this is from London.
(reading)
Mr. Gower cables you need cash. Stop. My
office instructed to advance you up to
twenty-five thousand dollars. Stop. Hee-
haw and Merry Christmas. Sam Wainwright.
The crowd breaks into a cheer as Ernie drops the telegram on top
of the pile of money on the table.
MARY
(calling out)
Mr. Martini. How about some wine?
As various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and
glasses, Janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord. She
starts playing "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," and the entire
crowd joins in the singing. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of the
various groups singing the hymn, and some people are still coming
in and dropping their money on the table. Carter, the bank
examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly looks at George
and tears his warrant in small pieces. In the midst of this scene,
Harry, in Naval uniform, enters, accompanied by Bert, the cop.
HARRY
Hello, George, how are you?
GEORGE
Harry... Harry...
HARRY
(as he sees the money)
Mary – looks like I got here too late.
BERT
Mary, I got him here from the airport as
quickly as I could. The fool flew all the
way up here in a blizzard.
Mrs. Bailey enters scene.
MRS. BAILEY
Harry, how about your banquet in New York?
HARRY
Oh, I left right in the middle of it as
soon as I got Mary's telegram.
Ernie hands Harry a glass of wine.
HARRY (CONT'D)
Good idea, Ernie. A toast... to my big
brother, George. The richest man in town!
Once more the crowd breaks into cheering and applause. Janie at
the piano and Bert on his accordion start playing "Auld Lang
syne," and everyone joins in.
CLOSE SHOT
George, still holding Zuzu in his arms, glances down at the pile
of money on the table. His eye catches something on top of the
pile, and he reaches down for it. It is Clarence's copy of "Tom
Sawyer." George opens it and finds an inscription written in it:
"Dear George, remember no man is a failure who has friends. Thanks
for the wings, Love Clarence."
MARY
(looking at book)
What's that?
GEORGE
That's a Christmas present from a very
dear friend of mine.
At this moment, perhaps because of the jostling of some of the
people on the other side of the tree, a little silver bell on the
Christmas tree swings to and fro with a silvery tinkle. Zuzu
closes the cover of the book, and points to the bell.
ZUZU
Look, Daddy. Teacher says, every time a
bell rings an angel gets his wings.
GEORGE
(smiling)
That's right, that's right.
He looks up toward the ceiling and winks.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Attaboy, Clarence.
The voices of the people singing swell into a final crescendo for
the
FADE OUT
THE END
