Alan Price (born 19 April 1942) is an English musician. He was the original keyboard player for the British band the Animals before he left to form his own band the Alan Price Set in the year 1965. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame museum in 1994 as a member of the Animals. He is also known for his musical work as a solo artist.[1]

Price helped create the Animals in Newcastle, England in 1962 with Eric Burdon, Hilton Valentine, Chas Chandler, and John Steel. They gained popularity in 1964 when their song "The House of the Rising Sun" achieved great success. Price left the Animals in 1965 due to disagreements with the group lead singer Eric Burdon, such as Price refusing to give royalties to "The House of the Rising Sun"[2] and went on to form The Alan Price Set. Price and Burdon have never officially made up, with Eric stating the last time he ever spoke or saw Price was in 1983, at an Animals reunion.[2]

Price was involved with the work of film director Lindsay Anderson. He wrote the music for Anderson's film O Lucky Man! (1973), which he performs on screen in the film and appears as himself in one part of the storyline. The score won the 1974 BAFTA Award for Best Film Music.[3]
