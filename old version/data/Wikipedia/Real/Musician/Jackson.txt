Signature

Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009), also known by his initials MJ, was an American singer, songwriter, singer-songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is often regarded as one of the most culturally significant figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his musical achievements broke racial barriers in the U.S. and made him a dominant figure across the world. Through songs, stages, and fashion, he proliferated visual performance for artists in popular music; popularizing street dance moves including the moonwalk, the robot, and the anti-gravity lean. Jackson is often deemed the greatest entertainer of all time.[1]

The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael began performing in 1964 with his brothers in the Jackson 5 at the age of 6. After signing with Motown in 1968, they gained worldwide fame with him as the group's lead singer and recorded multiple successful singles. In the early 1970s, he began his solo career, releasing the albums Got to Be There and Ben (both 1972), Music & Me (1973), and Forever, Michael (1975). Later, he rose to global stardom with the release of the albums Off the Wall (1979), Thriller (1982), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995), and Invincible (2001). When he died in 2009 at age 50, he had spent 44 years working in the music industry.

Jackson remains a global figure in popular culture. He created some of the best-selling albums in music history. His contributions to music, dance, and fashion had a major cultural impact. Finally, his highly publicized personal life kept him in the public eye. Jackson died in 2009 from an overdose of propofol administered by Dr. Conrad Murray. Murray's trial was widely publicized, and he went to prison for involuntary manslaughter.

Jackson influenced artists across many music genres. Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, the robot, and the anti-gravity lean. Jackson is the most awarded individual music artist in history: his awards include 15 Grammy Awards, 6 BRIT Awards, a Golden Globe, and 39 Guinness World Records, including "Most Successful Entertainer of All Time". He is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame, and the Dance Hall of Fame. Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 500 million records.

Voice

Jackson had a unique voice. Between 1971 and 1975, it changed from boy soprano to spinto tenor.

Jackson had a three and a half octave vocal range.[30] He is the best-known musician to use the 'vocal hiccup'. He first used it in 1973 on It's Too Late to Change the Time on The Jackson 5's G.I.T.: Get It Together album. Jackson also sang 'come on' wrongly on purpose so that it sounded like 'shamone'.
Personal life

Jackson lived a well-publicized personal life, even though he tried to stay private. He was often in celebrity and tabloid magazines. Later in his life, he was in magazines because of his personal life more than for his music.
Marriages and children

In 1994, Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of rock musician Elvis Presley. He divorced her in 1995 and married nurse Debbie Rowe in 1996.

Three months after Rowe and Jackson's marriage she gave birth to a son, Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. The next year she gave birth to a daughter, Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson. The couple divorced in April 2000.[31]

Prince Michael II was born on February 21, 2002. Jackson never said who the mother was. He is better known as Blanket. When Blanket was 8 months old, Jackson held him over a balcony with a towel over Blanket's head. At the time, people did not know that he was called Blanket. Jackson made a public apology after people got upset.[32]

After Jackson died, his mother Katherine was made the guardian of his children. In August 2012, Jackson's nephew TJ was made the children's co-guardian.[33]
Bubbles

In the 1980s, Jackson bought a chimpanzee from a Texas research facility. He named it Bubbles and used it for a pet.

Bubbles frequently traveled with Jackson, who had a strong attachment to the animal. The chimp, for example, was permitted to use Jackson's personal toilet.[34] As a result, people started to see Jackson as an eccentric.

The media mocked Jackson and called him "Wacko Jacko," which he hated.[35] Media coverage often focused on Bubbles, rather than on Jackson's music, and many false stories about the animal were told. One such story claimed that Bubbles was not a single ape, but one of several.[36][37]
Claims of sexual abuse
Main article: 1993 Michael Jackson sexual abuse allegations

In 1993, he was accused of child molestation, but there was no trial; the case was settled out of court.

In 2003, he was accused a second time of child molestation. In a TV documentary called Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson held hands with a 12-year-old boy called Gavin Arvizo and said that he shared his bed with children.[38] When he was 13, Gavin Arvizo accused Jackson of sexually abusing him. This time Jackson was tried in court, and in 2005 he was found not guilty of fourteen criminal charges.

In May 2013, on the Today show, a dancer called Wade Robson alleged that Jackson sexually abused him for 7 years. Prior to this, Robson had vehemently defended Jackson, including twice under oath.[39]
Appearance and health
Main article: Health and appearance of Michael Jackson
Hair

Over the years, Jackson's face and skin color changed. This attracted a lot of attention.

However, when he was filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984, Jackson got second-degree burns to his scalp. These were extremely painful, and Jackson started taking painkillers.

In his later years Jackson always wore a hairpiece or wig that blended with his natural hair. His autopsy found that his scalp was tattooed black so that it blended in with his wigs.[40]
Face

Jackson's face appeared to go through major changes during his career.

People especially talked about Jackson's nose. Jackson had an immune condition called discoid lupus. According to Dr. Richard Strick, Jackson had an immune condition called discoid lupus that "destroyed part of the skin of his nose".[41]

Jackson denied having plastic surgery to his face on more than a few occasions. When people pointed out that his face changed, he said that puberty, weight loss and his vegetarian diet were at fault.[42] But the change was so drastic that few people believed him.

Jackson's autopsy found that his lips were tattooed pink.[40][43]
Skin color

Jackson's skin color varied a lot during the course of his career. It seemed to get lighter over time. People accused Jackson of wanting lighter skin and bleaching his skin to make it that way.
Like Michael Jackson did, this person has vitiligo.

In truth, Jackson had vitiligo, a rare skin condition that creates light spots on the skin. (The skin around these spots keep their normal color.) Large areas of Jackson's body were very pale. He used makeup and medication to try to make his skin color look the same all over his body. This made it look like his skin tone was getting lighter.

Jackson first revealed that he had vitiligo in a 1993 television interview with Oprah Winfrey. Later, his autopsy confirmed that Jackson did have vitiligo, with large sections of white or lightened skin on his body.[44] It also noted that Jackson used a skin-bleaching cream called Benoquin to treat his vitiligo.[45]
Substance abuse

Jackson was allegedly addicted to prescription drugs. In fact, he died of a drug overdose. In 2009 his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, gave him intravenous Propofol for his insomnia. The insomnia was actually a side effect of Jackson's addiction to Demerol.[46] While Murray was out of the room, Jackson's heart stopped and he died.
This photo of Michael in 1969 shows his original skin color.

Jackson had many physicians (including Dr. Murray) who supplied him with medications, including controlled substances like Demerol.[46]
Mental health and trauma

Michael's father, Joe Jackson, abused him physically and emotionally during rehearsals.[47][48] When he found out his son was self-conscious about his appearance, his father called him "big-nose."[47][48]

Some people have suggested that Jackson had body dysmorphic disorder.[49][50][51] As a teenager, he had acne.[49] In Living With Michael Jackson, Jackson told Martin Bashir how he went home and cried after a woman called him ugly because of his acne.[52] The disorder is often triggered by appearance-related bullying.

Some people think that Jackson had anorexia nervosa.[53][54] In 1984, Jackson weighed 105 pounds. He was 5"9 tall. This would have made his BMI 15.5, which is very underweight.[55] He weighed 112 lbs. when he died. This is in the unhealthy range.[56]
Physical health

Jackson may have had a rare genetic disease called Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, according to a biographer called Ian Halperin.[57] Halpern wrote that Jackson's genetic disease had caused him to lose 95% of the vision in his left eye.[58] In fact, Jackson's doctor Conrad Murray said that he thought Jackson was "legally blind" and had phlebitis.[59][60]
Controversies

Aspects of Jackson's personal life, including his changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. He was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993, but the case was settled out of court. In 2003, Jackson was charged with child sexual abuse by Gavin Arvizo. In 2005, Jackson was found not guilty of all charges.
Death
Main article: Death of Michael Jackson
Michael's childhood home in Gary, Indiana with flowers left after his death

On June 25, 2009, Jackson was found without a heartbeat[61] and taken by ambulance to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. He had been unresponsive since 12:15. He arrived at the hospital with no signs of life. Though he was not pronounced dead when he arrived at the hospital, by 1pm he had already died. His death was announced that day at 2:25pm,[62] and confirmed by the Los Angeles coroner at 4:30pm.[63]

Jackson died just two months before his 51st birthday. The news of his death spread around the world very quickly. People around the world grieved on a scale never seen before.[64] Rumors and news items about Jackson's death broke records for web traffic. Jackson's death gave Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Yahoo the most page views they had ever encountered.[65][66] This enormous amount of Internet traffic caused a cyberspace traffic jam.
Dr. Murray

Jackson's doctor Conrad Murray, who supplied the Propofol, claimed Jackson took the overdose himself. However, the Coroner ruled the death was a homicide. Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter and served four years in prison.[67]

Propofol is used as anesthesia for major surgeries and requires heavy monitoring, including nurses and medical equipment.[68] Conrad Murray admitted to police that he had none of these when he gave Jackson the Propofol.[67] His autopsy discussed how dangerous Murray's actions were. It also noted that Jackson had an increased risk of respiratory failure because he had a lung injury.[40]
Memorial service

A two-hour memorial service was held at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles on July 7, 2009. It began with Smokey Robinson reading comments by Nelson Mandela, Diana Ross and other close friends of Jackson's who could not attend the memorial.[69]

Mariah Carey sang "I'll Be There" at the memorial service, followed by a speech given by Queen Latifah. Lionel Richie performed "Jesus is Love". Berry Gordy, Motown founder, spoke next, offering condolences. Kobe Bryant and Magic Johnson also spoke, with Magic describing the event as a "celebration of Jackson's life and works" rather than a funeral.
A memorial to Michael in Munich, Germany

Jennifer Hudson sang "Will You Be There" accompanied by a music video. Reverend Al Sharpton then gave a speech about how Jackson kept rising and "never stopped". John Mayer played the guitar as he did in Michael Jackson's song Human Nature. This was followed by Brooke Shields speaking.

Jermaine Jackson, Jackson's older brother, then performed Smile, Michael's favorite song written by comic drama legend Charlie Chaplin. Next to speak were Martin Luther King III and Bernice King. Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee followed them, claiming "people are innocent until proven guilty." (This was a reminder to people who accused Jackson of unproven child molestations). She also said that Jackson's humanitarian efforts should be praised.

Usher then sang "Gone Too Soon", followed by a montage of old videos of Jackson himself. Shamim sang next, with Kenny Ortega introducing him afterward. Kenny Ortega explained that Michael Jackson saw the Staples Center as his home, which is why the funeral service was held there. Ortega then sang a tribute to Jackson, including "We Are the World" and "Heal the World".

The service ended with speeches by members of Michael's family, including Jermaine, Marlon and daughter Paris. Paris began to cry and said that "Daddy was the best father anyone could have." She added "I will miss him" before leaving the microphone and turning into Janet Jackson's arms.
Burial

At first, Michael Jackson's custom-made quarter-million dollar golden casket, nicknamed "The Promethean," was not expected to appear at the memorial service. However, due to a change in the family's plans, the casket did appear.[70]

Viewing parties were held all over the world for the broadcast. Movie theaters showed the memorial service in Times Square, the Apollo Theater, Raleigh, and Berlin.[71] The broadcast was replayed a few times the next day. An estimated 1 billion people tuned into the farewell concert.

Over 3,000 police officers were assigned to the event, the largest amount assigned to a single event since the 1984 Summer Olympics.[72] It cost the City of Los Angeles 1.4 million dollars.[73]

Jackson's funeral took place nine weeks after he died, in Glendale, California on September 3, 2009. He was laid to rest at 9:45 pm in the mausoleum, above the ground. Some family members had wanted him to be buried below ground in the mausoleum, while Jermaine Jackson wanted him buried on Neverland ranch.[74] However, Michael's mother Katherine made the final decision.
Legacy

Through music videos and live performances, Jackson is known for popularizing dance moves such as the robot, the anti-gravity lean, the side slide, the crotch grab, and the moonwalk.[75]

He won many awards and broke records. He is the most successful entertainer of all time, according to Guinness World Records.

Jackson gave to many charitable organizations and pioneered efforts to raise funds for charities in the entertainment industry.

Jackson traveled the world attending events honoring his humanitarianism. In 2000, the Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer.

People continue to buy Jackson's albums and listen to his songs. He is one of the best-selling music artists in history, with worldwide sales approaching 400 million records.

Many of Michael Jackson's songs are still extremely popular. These include:

    "Bad"
    "Beat It"
    "Billie Jean"
    "Black or White"
    "Earth Song"
    "Heal the World"
    "Thriller"

Aftermath
Recent releases

Jackson recorded several songs before his death. He had recently released a compilation album called Michael (2010), featuring remixed songs and new songs such as "Hold My Hand" a duet between him and popular singer Akon, and "Monster", a strong song with lots of attitudes and a hint of dislike for the paparazzi. Also "(I Like) The Way You Love Me", "Keep Your Head Up", and "Much Too Soon".

In 2014, he released the second posthumous album, Xscape which includes the songs "Love Never Felt So Good" featuring Justin Timberlake, "Slave to the Rhythm", and "A Place With No Name".

A biopic based on Jackson's life and career was officially announced and will star Jermaine Jackson's son Jaafar Jackson as Michael Jackson. The movie will be released in April 2026.
