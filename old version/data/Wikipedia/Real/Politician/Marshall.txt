George Catlett Marshall (December 31, 1880 – October 16, 1959) was an American military leader. He was Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army during World War II, U.S. Secretary of State (1947-1949), and U.S. Secretary of Defense (1950-1951).

Marshall joined the U.S. Army in 1902 and served in France during World War I.

As Secretary of State, his name was given to the Marshall Plan, which was based on proposals by Lewis Brown and James Warburg and worked out by others in the U.S. State Department. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953.[1]
