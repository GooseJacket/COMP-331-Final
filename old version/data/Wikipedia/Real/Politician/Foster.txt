Born in Pike County, Indiana, and raised in Evansville, he was a lawyer. During the American Civil War, he was a general officer for the Union.[1] The Civil war ended in 1865. Between 1865 and 1869, Foster worked as a journalist for the Evansville Daily Journal.[2] After that, he was the U.S. Minister to Mexico (1873-1880), Russia (1880-1881) and Spain (1883-1885).[2] He was U.S. Secretary of State under President Benjamin Harrison from 1892-1893.[2] In 1895, he helped the Qing Dynasty in drafting the Treaty of Shimonoseki of 1895. He worked for the Chinese as a legal consultant and commissioner.[2]

His grandchildren included John Foster Dulles, who also became a U.S. Secretary of State,[2] Allen Welsh Dulles, a Director of Central Intelligence,[3] and Eleanor Lansing Dulles, economist and diplomat.[4] He is also the great-grandfather of the Catholic theologian Cardinal Avery Dulles.[3]
