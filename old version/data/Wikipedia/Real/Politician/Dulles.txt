Biography

Dulles was born on 25 February 1888 in Washington, DC. He went to public school in Watertown, New York, and also went to three different colleges. In 1908, he graduated from Princeton University, went to the Sorbonne in Paris for two years, and after this learned law at the George Washington University until 1911. That same year, he became a lawyer in New York City.[1]

He was part of the US Army in World War I in 1917 and 1918. After the war, he served as part of many groups involved in world and economic issues.[1]

On 7 July 1949, he became part of the United States Senate after Robert F. Wagner left the Senate. Dulles was part of the Senate until 8 November 1949, when an election for the position was held and he lost. In 1950, he was made a US representative to the United Nations.[1]

In 1953, he became Secretary of State, and served as such until 15 April 1959, when he left the position because of colorectal cancer.[1][2] He died on 24 May 1959.[2]
