Charles Curtis (January 25, 1860 – February 8, 1936) was an American politician. He was the 31st vice president of the United States from 1929 to 1933 under President Herbert Hoover. Before becoming vice president, he had been a senator and a representative from Kansas.

Curtis, the only Native American vice president in American history, was a member of the Kaw Nation. Curtis was the first vice president of color, the other being Vice President Kamala Harris. Curtis called himself "one-eighth Kaw Indian and a one-hundred percent Republican." In 1900, Kaw Chief Washungah called Curtis "one of our own men."[1]

Curtis grew up in Kansas and spoke the Kaw language. While he was in government, Curtis did some good things for Native Americans, but also some bad things. In 1898, he sponsored the Curtis Act of 1898, which took power away from tribal leaders.[1]
