Jean Elaine Grey-Summers, sometimes known as Marvel Girl and Phoenix, is a fictional character and superheroine from Marvel Comics. She was created by the late Stan Lee and the late Jack Kirby, and first appeared in X-Men #1 in September of 1963.

The heart and soul of the X-Men from the very beginning, Jean Grey took a piece of every one of her teammates with her when she died. A formidable telepath with telekinetic skills as well, Jean always struggled to contain the cosmic power of the Phoenix Force, a battle she endured until the day she died.
