Cosplayer of Daredevil.

Daredevil, also known as Matthew Michael "Matt" Murdock, is a superhero in the Marvel Comics universe. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, with input from Jack Kirby, he first appeared in Daredevil #1 in April 1964.
Fictional character biography

Matt Murdock is a blind lawyer from Hell's Kitchen, New York City. He lost his sight as a child after being hit by a truck while saving a man from being struck. However, the accident also heightened his other senses to superhuman levels, giving him an acute sense of hearing, touch, smell, and even a kind of radar sense that allows him to perceive his surroundings in a unique way.

By day, Murdock works as a lawyer alongside his friend and fellow attorney Foggy Nelson, fighting for justice in the courtroom. By night, he dons the costume of Daredevil, a masked vigilante who fights crime and protects the innocent, using his enhanced senses and martial arts skills. Daredevil's supporting characters are Karen Page, and love interest and partner Elektra. His arch-nemesis include Kingpin, Bullseye, and the Punisher.
Powers and abilities

Daredevil can perceive sounds at frequencies and volumes beyond human capability, allowing him to detect heartbeats, footsteps, and even whispers from great distances.

He can identify individuals by their unique scent and track people or objects based on their odor.

His sense of touch is highly developed, enabling him to perceive texture and vibrations, which adds to his situational awareness.

Daredevil can distinguish various chemicals and substances through taste, aiding in his investigations.

Daredevil's radar sense is perhaps his most distinctive ability, which allows him to visualize his surroundings in a sort of sonar-like way, creating a mental map of objects in his vicinity. This compensates for his lack of vision.

Trained in multiple martial arts, Daredevil is skilled in boxing, ninjutsu, judo, and more.

His agility and acrobatic skills allow him to perform complex flips, jumps, and maneuvers, often using his environment to his advantage.

Daredevil possesses enhanced agility and reflexes, making him exceptionally difficult to hit in combat. His acrobatics and balance are also top-notch, further complementing his fighting skills.

While not invulnerable, he can withstand strikes that would severely injure a normal human. His high pain threshold allows him to continue fighting despite injuries.

Daredevil often uses a versatile billy club that can be used as a close-quarter weapon, a grappling hook, or a tool for various situations. It can be thrown with great precision.

Aside from his superhero activities, Daredevil is a skilled lawyer, using his legal knowledge to fight for justice in the courtroom as well as on the streets.

Daredevil has an indomitable spirit and strong moral code, often driving him to fight against crime and injustice regardless of personal sacrifice.

All these skills and abilities make Daredevil a formidable hero, capable of taking on various threats while embodying themes of resilience, justice, and the struggle between good and evil.
Themes

Daredevil's stories often explore themes of faith, justice, and morality. Murdock is deeply influenced by his Catholic upbringing, which plays a significant role in his internal struggles and his pursuit of justice. The character is sometimes depicted as being conflicted between the law and vigilantism, often raising questions about the nature of justice and morality.
In other media

The character has adapted to different forms of media, including toys, movies, television series, and video games.

Matt Murdock was played by Ben Affleck in the 2003 movie Daredevil. Most recently he was played by Charlie Cox in the Marvel Television productions Daredevil and The Defenders on Netflix, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Affleck later made a cameo in a deleted scene of Elektra. Cox reprised his role for the movie Spider-Man: No Way Home in 2021, in the series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law in 2022, and for the upcoming series Daredevil: Born Again.

Daredevil remains a prominent and enduring figure in the Marvel Universe, known for his complex character arc and the rich narratives that explore the implications of his dual identity.
