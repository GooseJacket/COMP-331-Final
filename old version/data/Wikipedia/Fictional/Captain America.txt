In Real Life

In 1966, Joe Simon (one of the people who helped make Captain America) sued Marvel, saying that he was the one who should be able to use the character, not them. It was agreed that Captain America was made under the publisher's rules, and belonged to them. This meant that Marvel won. [1]
