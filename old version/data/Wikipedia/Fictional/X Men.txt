The X-Men, are a team of fictional characters and superheroes who were born with special mutant powers, making them different from regular humans. The X-Men characters are owned by Marvel Comics, which publishes comic books featuring them as well as many other superheroes. The comic book was one of the first to combine social issues and social commentary into a superhero story, set in a world where people with mutant abilities are hated by those born without them. This is similar to acts of ableism seen throughout history. Unlike "some" mutants, the X-Men try to be good and show tolerance toward humans and other mutants. The idea behind the superheroes were inspired by the African-American equality supporters like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.[1][2]

The X-Men team lineup has varied throughout the years and splintered into several other newer teams.

The original team lineup as created by writer Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, were Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast, Angel, and Iceman as well as Professor X. The leader and mentor of the X-Men is Professor Charles Xavier, who is more commonly known as "Professor X" and has mental powers. He wants to gain civil rights for mutants in the way that Martin Luther King Jr. did for African Americans; through peace.

Later issues brought fan favorites and frequent members including Cable, Colossus, Gambit, Nightcrawler, Polaris, Psylocke, Rogue, Storm and Wolverine.

Some of the X-Men's enemies include Magneto, Mystique, Sabretooth, Toad, Juggernaut, Mister Sinister, and Apocalypse. Magneto and Mystique eventually became X-Men. He wants to gain civil rights for mutants in the forceful style of Malcolm X.[3]

The X-Men characters have since been featured in various comic book series, motion pictures, toys, animated series, and much more.
